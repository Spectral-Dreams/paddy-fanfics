Chapter 6: Lowriders, Outriders
The sun shines down upon this city, hot and unrelenting as can be. Mortals begin to awaken and go about their whole routine of work, shopping, errands, school, or whatever.
Luciano Jr. is completely hungover, his clothes are messy and there's a tear in his pants. His head is pounding and he feels a bit nauseous. He rubs his temples and winces.
He's still in Mauve's Haven. Mauve herself has locked her bedroom door and fallen to the day-sleep, just like any other Kindred inevitably would.
Luciano Donovan Jr. bangs on Mauve's door and announces, his words slurred, "Hey! Heeeeeeey! I'm...headin' home now! I uh...I think we ord--ordered too much pizza. You can keep it, OK?!"
No reply.
Luciano groans and shuts his eyes tightly, a nasty headache forming. He thinks, "Fuck it. I'm heading back to my joint. Goddamn, what a night."
He trudges through the house, bumping into everything, and spilling some Fanta as he goes around. He grabs his stuff and heads outside.
It's only when he's a block away from the house that he realizes he's left his phone inside. He mutters some choice words and turns his car around.
Paul is coming around, his nose red from all the cocaine he was snorting throughout the night. He wakes up to a foul smell emanating from somewhere in the house.
He follows the smell, wondering where it's coming from. When he rounds a corner, he finds a bunch of pizzas carelessly tossed on the floor, along with some soda cans and discarded needles.
Flies are buzzing around this disgusting trash pile. Paul grimaces in disgust and gags at the smell.
He notices a bra lying on the couch and picks it up. It's not his, so he wonders whose it is. He notices traces of white powder inside the cup.
Paul is shocked and confused, but his face quickly turns into one of recognition, "Oh, shit...shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit."
Now the memory is coming back. Apparently, Mr. Cho sniffed some coke from one of the bra cups and got quite high. It was all part of some dare or something.
Paul feels a pit in his stomach and shakily laughs, "Oh, man. T--That was awesome!"
Luciano barges in and frantically looks around for the phone. There's a few other people still here, either snoring loudly or passed out from the wild partaying.
Paul's heart skips a beat when he sees Luciano come in, "Whoa! Oh...oh, shit. It's you."
He clears his throat awkwardly, "What--what happened last night, man?"
Luciano chuckles, "You went wild. I went wild. The whole place went wild, man! Damn, it's been a while since I've partied hard."
Paul searches for his pants amongst this sea of tangled limbs, plastic wrappers, and empty pizza boxes, "A--Are you serious, man? Oh, man..."
Luciano's eyebrows go up and down, "I'm serious, man. I had to drag you to a corner and cool you off. You really do know how to bury your beak in some blow, huh?"
Paul shakily sighs, his lower lip quivering, "Shiiiit."
His tone is frantic, "You think anyone's ever gonna find out, man?"
"Find out what? The cops came by and I gave 'em a little...something for their trouble, heh."
Paul remembers that and he shoots his friend a disapproving look, "I still don't like it when we--you have to do that. I'd much prefer playing within the rules."
Luciano sneers, "Oh, sure. You're always so...so...polite, aren't you, Paulie? It's fucking boring, man. You're boring when you get all uptight and legal with me. I already got Gordon on my ass about this stuff, I don't need you doing it, too!"
Paul ignores that and finally finds his pants behind the table. How they ended up there is anyone's guess. He slips into them and pulls the zipper up.
He looks around and asks, "Man, who--who are these people?"
Luciano laughs, "I think some of them are the investors. Hey, you got a sharpie on ya? I wanna do a lil funny thing. You know, a little prank, heh."
"Uh, yeah. Hold on." Paul fumbles around the nearby drawers and retrieves a sharpie. He offers it to his best friend, "Here."
Luciano can barely hold the sharpie, the effects of the Fanta mixed with booze still in his system.
"I don't think I can really hold the damn thing, man."
"Just write something! Sheesh, I don't care. What are you gonna write, huh, huh?"
Luciano sneers, "I'm thinking, wait, wait."
Their intended victim is an older-looking man with graying hair. Drool is leaking from his mouth and his head is resting on the table.
Luciano scrawls a few words on the man's forehead and he drops the sharpie, his hand shaking.
Paul giggles and suddenly feels the urge to take a piss. He quickly makes his way to the bathroom and pees in the sink. The toilet is clogged up with used condoms and a few bottles of very expensive alcohol.
He shakes his head and returns to the living room, "Oh, fuck..."
Luciano, now sober and clear-headed, looks over at his friend, "What's up, P-money?"
Paul beckons to the bathroom, "It's like a horror flick in there, man. I had to take a leak in the sink 'cause someone fucking clogged the toilet."
Luciano grimaces, "What? Are you fucking serious? Who the fuck did that?"
"Who the fuck knows, man?"
"Shit. I--I guess I gotta hire someone to get this cleaned up. I know Mauve's practically used to living in shit like this, but I got a rep to uphold and all. I mean, what if people start asking questions?"
Paul shrugs, "What if they do? I--I mean, it's not like we were doing anything wrong. It's all in good fun, man. Right?"
Luciano concurs, "Yeah. All good fun. C'mon, let's leave this place. I'll send someone over to clean it up in the afternoon."
Before leaving, Luciano bangs on Mauve's bedroom door, "HEY! Sleepyhead! We're leaving! Someone's comin' 'round in the afternoon to uh--"
He stops and looks around at the mess, "--do some very light cleaning. Don't worry, we didn't make too much of a mess. N--not like it matters, anyway since I'm the one who pays for this place."
Paul calls out, "Yeah, don't you fucking forget that, Mauve!"
LDJ calms his buddy down, "Easy, easy, she got the point."
He bangs on the door once more, "Keep doing what you're doing; keep laying them golden eggs, alright?"
He frowns and tries the handle, it's locked, "I said, ALRIGHT?!"
The Malkavian is deep in her day-sleep, completely and totally oblivious to the world around her.
LDJ throws his hands up and shrugs. The 2 men leave and return to their vehicles. The others eventually come around, get their stuff and get the fuck out of Mauve's Haven.
As he drives, LDJ tells Paul, "What a fuckin' night, man. Goddamn, we really are moving on up in the world, huh?"
Paul keeps touching his nose, "Mm-hmm. Let's hope your golden goose lays us a billion dollar egg soon."
Luciano agrees with a laugh, "We'll see. We'll see. Oh, shit, I better call Gordon and ask him how everything went, y'know with the--"
Paul holds up a finger, "I--I don't wanna hear about it. The less I know about that, the better. Honestly, I--I uh...don't like that we had to resort to violence to get rid of this SEC guy."
Luciano retorts, "Then why were you so excited about it yesterday, huh? As I recall, you wanted to meet the fucking hitman and shit."
Paul gets all erratic, "I was j--just saying that to play along, y'know. I wish we could have paid off this SEC guy or something along those lines. But Gordon...Gordon's good at what he does. He knows how to handle it, y'know?"
Luciano's expression grows dark, "Yeah. He knows how to handle it alright. Call him up for me."
Paul's vision is very blurry, so he struggles to see the numbers on LDJ's car phone, "Uh...which one do you press...?"
Luciano slams the brakes and snatches the phone from Paul's clumsy hands, "Jesus, Paul. It's a fucking phone. It ain't that hard."
Paul's hands start to tremble, his eyes darting around, as if trying to find some happy dust he can snort, "Mmm. I...I feel sick. I'm gonna--I'm gonna throw up."
Luciano rolls his eyes, "Jesus, dude. I ain't going back for the blow now. But don't worry, I stashed it in a safe place."
Paul's eyes widen in shock, "Y--You did what?! Are you fucking crazy?! Do you know how much that shit cost me?!"
"Easy, alright? It's in a SAFE PLACE, OK?! Goddamn. You know what, just...let me talk to Gordon now. Alright?"
The car is stopped in the middle of the street and people are honking their horns and yelling at them.
Luciano yells back, "Yeah, fuck you too!"
The cars go around LDJ's vehicle and continue on their way. Luciano dials up Gordon's number. It rings a few times before the he picks up. He sounds tired and worn out, "What is it, Luciano?"
"Eeeey, Pym Reaper! So, how'd the thing with the thing go?"
Gordon releases a long sigh, "Something seemed to have gone wrong--"
"WHAT?!" Luciano explodes. Paul flinches and covers his ears. He's starting to feel even more nauseous than before. His head is pounding and his nose is running.
He can't stop sniffling. His eyes are watering.
Gordon growls, "Shut up, Luciano. I'm on my way to handle it right now."
"What exactly happened?"
"The hitter apparently confirmed the kill, but he failed to show up at the rendezvous point."
Luciano growls, "FUCK! So, where the fuck is he then?"
"I don't know. Nobody does."
Paul pokes Luciano's shoulder, "Is--is that Markham guy dead or what? Ask him, ask him!!"
Luciano waves his hand dismissively, "Hold on, hold on. So, is Markham Reed dead or what?"
Gordon replies, "I don't know. That's what I'm trying to find out before you called and started yelling in my ear. Don't worry, I'll get to the bottom of this."
Luciano orders, "Yeah, you better. That shit cost me 60 large. If Reed's still walking, I want a fucking refund. You tell that to whoever the fuck it is you're supposed to be meeting up with, got it?"
Gordon sighs again, "I understand. I'll get to the bottom of this. Good day." He hangs up.
LDJ angrily tosses the phone aside and starts the car up again.
Paul looks VERY concerned, "So, so...what's the deal? The SEC guy IS dead, right? RIGHT?!"
Luciano retorts, "Shut up, Paul! Lemme...lemme think for a sec, OK?! Goddamn." He rubs his temples and takes a few deep breaths. Paul sits there, his eyes darting around, his fingers twitching.
He's getting withdrawal symptoms. He's desperate for a line of coke.
LDJ shakes his head, "I'll drop you back at your place. Snort as much blow as you have to. After that, get on the fucking phone and call your contacts up in the Federal Government."
Paul complies with a frantic nod of the head, "Y--Yes, yes, yes, yes. I'll do it. I'll do it." He's sweating profusely and he keeps looking around.
Luciano tells himself, "And I'll try some damage control from my end. Heh, maybe y--you were right, Paul. We should've tried something a lot less violent than this. But what's done is done. Now, we gotta clean up the mess."
Paul nods again, "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I--I totally agree, man."
Gordon is on his way to a long-abandoned industrial complex on the outskirts of Flimont City. He's hoping that he can learn more about why the hitter has failed to check in after supposedly killing Markham Reed.
Overgrowth covers most of the building's exterior, and the windows are all broken. It's been abandoned for years, and it's not the first time that Gordon has used this place as a meeting spot.
He parks his 7th generation Impala nearby and walks into the building. Nature has clearly reclaimed this place. Vines and other plants have overrun the interior, making it difficult to move around.
The ground is covered in dirt, cigarette butts, and broken glass. There's also a few needles here and there. Gordon steps over some empty Pringles cans and makes his way to the main area of the building.
He walks through the darkness, his flashlight shining the way. He goes down to the basement and finds a metal door.
A woman points her gun at Gordon's head. He lightly gasps and raises his hands when he feels the barrel against his head. The woman speaks, her voice raspy and hoarse, "You're late."
Gordon's voice is calm and collected, "I'm sorry. Traffic in this city- you know how it is. I was told to meet your boss here."
The woman holds out a burlap sack, "Not here. Put this on and follow me."
Gordon's breathing is shaky, but he does as he's told. He puts the sack over his head and follows the woman. She leads him to a van parked outside the building.
She opens the back door and pushes Gordon inside.
75 minutes later...
The van has been going around in circles, stopping here and there; clearly, the driver is doing their best to completely disorient Gordo's sense of direction.
After a while, the van stops and the woman pulls Gordon out. He can hear the sound of waves crashing against rocks. The woman pulls the sack off of Gordon's head.
They're in a dimly-lit office space. The sounds of the waves appear to be coming from a recording played on a nearby speaker. There's a large desk in the center of the room, and a man is sitting behind it.
The man is wearing a black suit, a white shirt, and a black tie. He's in his 70s, wrinkly face, and gaunt look. He has a cigar in his mouth, and he's puffing on it.
Gordon gulps and tries to keep his cool, "I assume all the cloak and dagger nonsense was for your benefit, Mister...?"
"Strickland. Call me Mr. Strickland. I only agreed to this meeting because your reputation precedes you, Mr. Pym."
Judging by Mr. Strickland's accent, he was the guy Gordon spoke to yesterday at that payphone.
Gordon sharply points out, "Ah, that accent. You were the one I spoke to yesterday. Did Mr. Percy check in with you yet?"
Mr. Strickland shrugs and taps out some ashes into a nearby ashtray, "No, not yet. He's a professional, this is most...unbecoming of him."
Gordon clears his throat, "But, he did confirm that Markham Reed is dead, right?"
"Mm-hmm. Yet--" Mr. Strickland springs up from his seat and paces around the room, "--something curious has happened."
Gordon narrows his eyes, "What do you mean by that?"
Mr. Strickland snaps his fingers and the woman from earlier slides a folder over to Gordon. He picks it up and opens it. Inside are a few photos of Markham Reed exiting the hotel.
The timestamp clearly shows the photos were taken after Daniel confirmed the kill. Gordon frowns and looks up at Mr. Strickland, "This...this doesn't make any sense. Are you sure these photos are genuine?"
Mr. Strickland replies, "Of course they are, Mr. Pym. Do you think I waste people's time with fakes? Tch."
He adds, "Something's not adding up here. Daniel would never lie, he's a damn good killer. And yet..."
Gordon shakes his head, "I don't understand. What could have possibly happened?"
Mr. Strickland paces around some more, "Perhaps...perhaps he made a mistake. It's highly unlikely, of course. The man is well-trained, after all."
Gordon suggests, "Maybe he's playing us for fools. Maybe he's trying to extort you for more money. It's not unusual for pros to get greedy."
Mr. Strickland dismisses that idea, "No, no. He agreed on the $60,000. Subtracting my...small cut, of course. No, something else is going on here. Something very peculiar and unusual."
Gordon asks, "How do you know he's not dead?"
Mr. Strickland shoots back, "If he's dead, then where's the body? And, more importantly, who killed him? Could Markham Reed have done it AFTER Daniel confirmed the kill?"
Gordon shrugs, "It's possible. But, that would mean that he somehow managed to survive being shot multiple times in the back."
Mr. Strickland stops pacing around and sits back down with a huff, "Hmph, that is an enigma, is it not. No man, woman, or person, no matter how strong or armored, can survive that many shots from a suppressed pistol at close range."
Gordon thinks for a moment, "Unless..."
Mr. Strickland leans forward, "Unless what?"
Gordon calmly muses, "Unless your hitman chose another method."
"No. Impossible. I know Daniel, personally. He prefers shots to the back of the head or multiple in the body. As a last resort, he might use his bowie knife, but that's only if he needs to get up close and personal."
Gordon says, "Well, he could have simply missed. He could have been rushed by someone else in the room. Or, maybe he's lying dead in a ditch somewhere."
Mr. Strickland's eyes glaze over, "The 3rd possibility is what concerns me the most. Yet, no corpse has washed up yet. I have my people watching the city morgue around the clock. Nothing."
"What about the hotel room Markham was staying at?"
Mr. Strickland shrugs, "Cleaned from top to bottom, apparently. Reed even paid his bills and left a tip for the cleaning staff."
Gordon scoffs, "That's odd."
Mr. Strickland agrees, "Indeed. Quite odd. Something's not right here, Mr. Pym. I have a strong feeling that this is not some mere Federal Government employee we're dealing with."
Gordon concurs, "You may be right, Mr. Strickland. I'll do some digging on my end. In the meantime, I'd suggest you keep a low profile."
Mr. Strickland claps back, "Don't tell another professional how to do his job. I normally don't go out of my way to meet clients- smoke, mirrors, and all that theatrical nonsense. But, I'm willing to make an exception for you, Mr. Pym."
Gordon raises an eyebrow, "Why?"
Mr. Strickland explains, "Your reputation precedes you. Besides, it's not the 1st time you're utilizing our services. Remember the Penbrookes?"
Gordon recalls that incident, "Yes, yes. I remember them quite well. They were a thorn in my client's side for years. It's a shame they had to die like that, though." There's a hint of dark and disturbing satisfaction in his tone.
Mr. Strickland continues, "Indeed. Indeed. 4 people- husband, wife, her sister, and a kid. Hmph." There's no remorse or regret in his voice.
Gordon gets up, "Well, I'll be in touch, Mr. Strickland. If you hear anything from your hitter, please let me know."
Mr. Strickland nods, "Of course. I don't give up on my people that easily?"
"Why?"
Mr. Strickland explains, "All of those who work under me are soldiers. They are without purpose, for the time being. I fill that void, that desire to kill, to serve. They have no families, no friends, no attachments, nothing. All they have is me."
Gordon slowly nods, "I see. Well, thank you for your time, Mr. Strickland."
Mr. Strickland goes on, "All they know is how to fight, kill, and die. I give them purpose, I hone and sharpen their unique...skills. I am their shepherd, their leader, their general. They are my soldiers, and I am their commander."
Gordon snarks, "It seems your Daniel might've done the last part, heh."
Mr. Strickland scoffs, "If that is the case, then he served his country valiantly. Regardless, there is another thing that might be of interest to you, Mr. Pym."
Gordon's eyebrow perches up, "Oh? What's that?"
Mr. Strickland slides over another folder, "This is the dossier on someone our target was conversing with right before he 'died'. He's a rather interesting fellow, if I do say so myself."
Gordon opens the folder and looks through it, a blank and neutral expression on his face as he mutters, "Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Interesting."
Mr. Strickland inquires, "What do you think?"
Gordon responds, "I think...I think it should be taken care of as well."
Mr. Strickland smirks, "Understood. For this one, we'll charge you...$20,000."
Gordon is surprised, "That's unusually cheap."
"It's been a thorn in our side for years. He could do some damage to our operation."
"Hmm, I see. So, when will it be done?"
Mr. Strickland drums his fingers on the table, "As soon as possible, Mr. Pym. As soon as possible."
Gordon nods, "I understand. Thank you for your time, Mr. Strickland. And it's finally good to put a face behind that voice I spoke to yesterday."
Mr. Strickland chuckles, "Likewise, Mr. Pym. Likewise. Good day."
Gordon turns and leaves. The woman escorts him out of the building and back to the van.
Gordon groans, "Again?"
The woman dryly claps back, "Would you rather I chloroformed you?"
"Hmph, no. Can you at least give me a cleaner sack. That one smelt like cheap aftershave..."
The same sack goes back on Gordon's head. The van drives off, its destination: the industrial area where it picked up Gordon earlier.
The woman removes the sack and points her gun at Gordon again, "Get out. And forget how my boss looked. He doesn't normally agree to physical meetups. I don't know what he was thinking, tch."
Gordon does so, "Thank you. I hope we can work together again sometime."
"Hmph." The woman starts the van and drives off, the tires screeching as she speeds away. Gordon watches her go and shakes his head.
He walks over to his Impala and gets in. He takes a few deep breaths and calms himself down.
He asks himself, "What the hell have I gotten myself into here? Goddamn...anyway, I'll wire the $20,000 to Strickland as soon as I can. Then, I'll call Luciano and tell him the good news. Hopefully, he won't bitch about it too much."
He starts the car and drives off. He has a lot of (terrible and thankless) work to do.
The afternoon sun ruthlessly blazes and bathes the city in a terrible and harsh glow. Mauve's Haven is still as filthy as ever. Luciano called a professional cleaner to clean it up a while ago.
She arrived, grimaced at the horror show in front of her, held her breath when she needed to, cleaned up, and left a note on Mauve's desk.
The cleaner kept trying Mauve's bedroom door, but it had to be locked for obvious reasons.
The note on Mauve's desk reads: "All done. Charges included for 3 hours and all supplies. Thank you." It's signed by the cleaner. A business card is also taped to the note. 
It reads: "If you need our services again, please feel free to give us a call. Regards, Diana. PS- Nice place."
The cleaner goes back to her van and throws her head back. She loudly exhales and fans herself with a women's magazine that's been sitting around in her van.
"Hoooooof. Shame I had to throw out all those pizzas. What a waste. I--I probably should've helped myself to some of it, but clients tend to get all pissy if they think I've been eating their stuff. What do you think, Jerry?"
Jerry is the cleaner's stuffed lion, 1 eye hanging by a thread, fur faded, and nose chewed up.
Diana chuckles, "Yeah, I thought so. C'mon, let's go grab a quick bite at Jersey Mike's. Or, should we go to the Jersey Mike's knockoff on 10th Avenue?"
Jerry dangles lifelessly from the rearview mirror and the cleaner chuckles again. She turns her radio on and begins humming to herself.
Jerry, the scrappy stuffed lion decoration piece, doesn't talk back. That doesn't stop his owner, Diana, from carrying on entire conversations with him, as if he were a real person.
She turns her van around and drives away, the smell of pizzas still lingering in her nose. Diana thinks about what to eat at the restaurant, "Should we go for the sub or a wrap? Maybe a burrito?"
She playfully pokes Jerry, sending him swinging from the rearview mirror, "I know what you want- the sub, heh." She giggles at her own joke. Jerry is a good listener. That's all she really wants right now.
Diana stops her van and pulls out her flip phone. She dials the number of her gruff and nasty boss, dreading the conversation. He always seems to find something wrong, no matter what she does.
"Hello?" He says, sounding like he woke up from a nap.
"It's me. Diana. I've done the job. No one was there, so I just left a note on the client's desk."
"Mmmrph. Ah, Diana. My favorite 'woman'. You do good work, don't you, toots?" She hears the sounds of his chomping, no doubt, eating some junk food as he talks.
She continues, "It--It's...I also think it's time we talked about a uh...raise, yeah. Rent's kinda due and all. I also need to pick up a few more hours, you know how it is..." she trails off.
"Hmm, that's good work. Mmmrph. Raise, huh? The fuck, Diana?! Do I look like I run some kind of charity for you people?! Ehh? The hell, Diana! Fuckin'...waking me for this bullshit!"
"B--But, boss--" he hangs up before Diana can say anything more.
She growls and slams the dashboard, "FUCK! This is...this is some BULLSHIT!! It--It's not like I have any other way of making a living in this city, y'know?" She looks over at Jerry for reassurance, but the inanimate object doesn't reply.
She shakes her head and drives off to the Jersey Mike's knockoff for a sub and a milkshake. Maybe the milkshake will cheer her up and take her mind off of things. Or, maybe not.
She's not sure. She'll try it out and see.
As she drives, she hums the tune of whatever's on the radio. On the back of her mind, however, she was wondering how she was gonna pay this week's rent. She's also behind on some bills, but the company she works for refuses to properly compensate their employees.
She works for a company called: "Worbo's Professional Cleaning Services", owned and run by an asshole named "Mike Winters".
The boss's name sounds hella suspicious, and Diana suspects it's just a pseudonym, a way of avoiding the law (or an angry ex). She doesn't ask any questions because this job's all she has and she doesn't want to risk getting fired.
But, even this crappy and thankless job of professional cleaning doesn't pay well enough. Diana sighs, she has to work a lot more hours just to scrape by.
Her boss, on the other hand, boasted about buying and importing a nasty-looking Dalmatian with that very same money he wouldn't give to his employees.
Asshole.
Diana knows she should quit this job, but where would she find work elsewhere? Her hands are tied and her boss is an asshole. Besides, in a money-crazed city like Flimont, there aren't many good, decent-paying jobs going around.
She has a degree in Classical History, but Flimont's more elite denizens don't give a shit about art, culture, history, science, or anything that doesn't immediately yield maximum returns.
She sighs once more as she pulls into a parking space outside of the Jersey Mike's knockoff. Diana decides that she's going to go in for a BLT sub. After that, she has some more cleaning assignments to attend to.
She tells her stuffed companion, "Don't worry, I'll get you a soft and chewy drop sugar cookie, heh."
The Jersey Mike's knockoff is actually called: "Uncle Steve's!" It was some writer for the Flimont Times who first called it a "Jersey Mike's knockoff" due to the similarities of the eateries. It's been catching on like wildfire.
The store owner wasn't pleased by that at all. He got even more upset when it became the unofficial name for this place.
Diana walks into the store, the scent of freshly-cooked meats filling the air. She takes it all in through her nostrils, sighing with pleasure. Uncle Steve's sure does know how to cook meat.
The door closes behind her and she goes up to the counter, where an acne-riddled and bored-looking cashier waits.
Sounding as dull as ever, he says, "Welcome to Uncle Steve's, home of the subs and all that. Can I take your order."
Diana strokes her chin and looks at the menu on the wall. She nods, "Uh...lemme see." She pauses for a moment and looks around.
The floors are checkerboarded, the walls are painted in a shade of light blue. The place isn't too full at this time, but it isn't wholly empty. Some people are in their cars, ordering through the window.
Others are on their lunch break and just relaxing in their booths.
The TV's playing some music channel. The screen shows an ad for a new product being sold by a very well-known company.
The cashier is annoyed and asks, "Can I take your order?"
Diana looks at the beautiful woman on the TV screen and runs a hand down her face, eyes glazing over. Her voice cracks a bit when she replies, "U--Uh...yeah! Uhh...uhhhhh. Just give me the uh..." her eyes dart all around.
She finally says, "Yeah, gimme a Uncle's Club Special. Hold the olives. Also gimme the um...Oreo Milkshake. And 2 sugar cookies. Thanks!"
"Whatever," the cashier dude dully says as he repeats her order.
"Cash or card?" he asks, tapping a few numbers into the cash register.
Diana's hand fishes through her pockets and pulls out a few bills, "Uh, cash, I guess." She hands it over to him with a warm smile, "Keep the change, kid."
The cashier is caught off-guard by her warm smile and nods with a nervous chuckle, "Y--Yeah, uh...thanks." He punches a few more buttons into the register and Diana gets her receipt.
She waits for about 10 minutes before her order is finally ready. She's feeling a bit drowsy from all that work she did earlier and her hands are kinda numb. But, the promise of a good sandwich and a delicious milkshake is keeping her awake.
She quietly sits in a secluded booth at the far back of the restaurant, not wanting to be disturbed. She unwraps the sub and starts devouring it. The Oreo milkshake is very creamy and tastes a lot better than Diana initially imagined.
With her mouth full, she says, "Damn, this is actually quite good for a blatant Jersey Mike's knockoff. Heh, heh."
After eating, she gets back in her van and tosses the packet of cookies onto the seat next to her.
She says to him, "Enjoy the meal, bud. I would've loved to sit back, but no rest for the wicked in this city, heh."
Jerry says nothing in response and Diana just chuckles as she starts her van. She heads off to her next job assignment, the sun as bright and as unrelenting as ever.
She starts to think about her next plan of action regarding her crappy job and all of the crap she has to put up with.
As she drives, her radio plays some terrible 90's pop song.
"Blurgh. This. Again. Sheesh. It'd be nice to have some nice music on the radio. Right, Jerry?"
Poor Jerry looks like he's melting under the unforgiving sun.
"Y--Yeah. Yeah. You know what? I think I've made up my mind. I'm gonna talk to Winters. Ask him for that raise. I've been with the company for like...6 years now. If anything, I'm kinda overdue for a raise."
Given how hot it is, Diana turns on the A/C and cranks it up. She makes sure all the windows in her crappy van are rolled up, but the window to Jerry's side is jammed, so she decides to leave it the way it is.
"Anyway, Jerry. I don't like how that guy says he's in crippling debt, but somehow...SOMEHOW manages to find enough money to get himself a dog from another country. Make it make sense, my stuffed friend."

Diana shakes her head, "Yeah, I thought so. God, traffic's really starting to get thick now. Ugh...I guess it IS the afternoon, after all."
In time, afternoon gives way to evening. The sun begins its slow descent in the horizon, coloring the sky with an ethereal orange-pink glow. The air starts to cool down as the day draws to a close.
A person like Diana will work and work and work till dinnertime. She (like many others) ekes out an existence, living in this unforgiving city where the strong devour the weak. There is no real (or apparent) escape. There is no paradise in sight.
This is what they all know, and what they've been conditioned into passively accepting.
The Kindred prepare to awaken and their Ghouls (where applicable) begin setting up. The vampires in this part of the world prepare to go about their Unlives.
Markham groans and hears the words of his Sire echoing in his troubled mind: "Survival's the game we all play. Some of us do better than others."
The Baali gets off his tough mattress and goes upstairs to the living room. Surprisingly, his Gangrel hosts are ready and chatting at a circular table in the kitchen. There are some books stacked on it. Markham wonders what's in those books.
Maybe more of abuela's old stuff that neither Diego nor Marisol could get rid of? Or maybe something else entirely. Who knows. But, that doesn't matter at the moment.
Diego is dressed in scrappy work clothes- a t-shirt and a pair of rough and baggy jeans. Marisol is dressed in office casuals, her striped shirt is buttoned-down and a necklace with a gold crucifix dangles from her neck.
Marisol's hair is neatly brushed and her shoes are at the front door. Her outfit looks a lot cleaner than Diego's and it smells more fragrant, too.
Marisol silently nods over to the Baali. Diego holds out his hands, "Eyyy! Devil man! Sleep well?"
Markham dryly nods, "Mm-hmm."
Diego invites Markham to take a seat at the table. Marisol regards her Baali guest in a cold and almost distant manner. There is little warmth in her eyes when she looks at him.
Still, a part of her knows it's not good to turn down a vato in distress, and Markham has certainly been through a lot!
Diego eases the tension by inquiring, "So, I hope Marisol's abuela's old mattress wasn't too...uh...hard on you, haha." There's some awkwardness in his tone.
Markham shrugs and rolls a shoulder, "It's fine. Thanks." The last thing he wants to do is run afoul of the only Gangrel who's (so far) being decent to him.
Marisol shoots her boyfriend an annoyed glare, "Hmph." Her face is cold and severe.
Diego shoots her a goofy smile and tells her, "It's alright, it's alright. Your buddies at the office won't give a shit if you're 2 minutes late."
In an attempt to break the ice, Markham asks Marisol, "So, Marisol, where do you work?"
Marisol leans back, her chair creaking from the pressure, "I work in sales for a small company." She's clearly very tired. There are dark circles around her eyes.
Diego bitterly chuckles, "They treat her like dirt, man."
Markham nods, "I'm sorry to hear that."
Diego sighs, "Yeah, we're decades late to all the good jobs in this city."
The Baali motions for the Feral to explain, which he gladly does, "Deindustrialization hit this city hard, homes. Like, real hard. The jobs started drying up and the infrastructure falling to shit." Diego has a very distant look in his eyes and he smiles, but his expression is full of sadness, pain, and regret.
Marisol puts her cold hand on her boyfriend's cold(er) hand, "There's nothing we can do about it, D. Best we can do is..."
She looks at Markham and says, "...survive the worst of it. It's what--it's the only thing we can afford to do, no?"
The Baali signals his agreement with a short nod of the head.
Diego smiles at his girlfriend and goes on, "People, well those who could afford to, left this city. Hell, Marisol is lucky to have her office job. Without it..." He shudders, not wanting to think of what Unlife would be like if his girlfriend were out of work.
Markham knows this is something that's plagued many in Y2K America, "Yeah, all that Y2K optimism faded out pretty fast." He has this distant and faraway look on his face.
Diego concurs, "Yeah, man. The new century was supposed to show some promise, but it's just a continuation of all the bad shit from the last century."
Marisol blandly speaks up, "Just because the calendars changed doesn't mean the world did."
Diego queries, "So, what do you do for work, huh?"
Markham answers, "I'm an Enforcement Investigator for the SEC."
Marisol softly chuckles and shakes her head, "The Securities and Exchange Commission, huh? How long you been doing that for? It can't have been that long."
"I started in the 90s, so it's been a decade."
Diego whistles, somewhat impressed, "And your 'cover' hasn't like, been blown or anything? All your co-workers getting old and crusty while you remain pale and fresh is gonna raise some 'brows, y'know?"
Markham shrugs, "So far, nobody's grown suspicious and I hope it stays that way for the foreseeable future." Yet, on the back of his mind, Markham thinks about how long he can keep working for the SEC without breaching the Masquerade or getting discovered.
Marisol sighs and prods, "So, what does an Enforcement Investigator do, hmm? I'd like to know that my tax dollars are being wisely spent, Mr...?"
"Reed. I um...investigate fraud and other crimes that occur in the securities and financial markets. I also aid in any enforcement actions taken by the agency." Markham's tone is rather detached, like he's reciting a script.
Diego chimes in, "Sounds kinda cool, if you ask me."
Markham indifferently responds, "If paper trails, research, waiting around, and a lot of talking to and dealing with unlikable types is your idea of 'cool', then sure."
Marisol directly states, "Well, you've come to the right city, Mr. Reed. I once read that it was shaping up to be the capital of market manipulation, tax evasions, fraud, ponzi schemes, and shit like that."
Markham fully agrees, "Yeah, I got that impression, too."
Diego queries, "So, the buster who tried to 'kill' you last night- work-related hazard, hmm? Shit like that happen often in your line of work?"
Markham sighs, "It looks that way, but I'm still not comfortable discussing the details of an ongoing investigation, or prior ones. As for things like this happening often, there doesn't seem to be a precedent for it...as far as I'm aware, but this city is...different."
Marisol blithely declares, "Tch, yeah it is. You've got people born with and into millions and then turning it into bigger millions or billions by manipulating complicated financial instruments that no one or few of us understand. Tch."
Diego snickers and agrees with his girl. Once the financial speculator types started getting their claws in this city, they made it their mission to make things even more complicated (and shittier) just so they could make it big.
They also took their own sweet time in doing it. Now, only the smartest and most educated (or well-informed or those in-the-know) can really understand the system and how its been rigged to benefit a sliver of the population.
Marisol further inquires, "I know you don't wanna talk about it, but which one of these pendejos are you looking into, anyway? Hmm?"
For a moment, the Baali hesitates, but he doesn't wanna be a rude guest or give the impression of being ungrateful. He knows that he needs to play nice with these Ferals and he shouldn't piss them off.
After all, they are giving him a mattress to day-sleep on, even if it is as hard as rock!
Markham finally tells the 2 Outlanders, "2 stockbrokers by the names of Luciano Donovan Junior and his close friend, Paul Cho."
Diego lets out a long whistle, "Oh, those vatos, huh? Sheesh. I know the Asian guy, Paul. Word on the streets is he's uh...he's got a dope habit."
He does the bunny ears gesture with his fingers, "A 'mild' cocaine habit from what I've heard. I remember someone from our Clan said he came here once trying to score, but just cause we're Cholos doesn't mean we carry that shit around."
"Interesting."
Marisol shakes her head, disgusted with it all, "Tsk. Rich people like that go through life, not having to worry about anything like bills, taxes, debt, food, water, mortgage, and rent. Meanwhile, we're just trying to stay alive here. I've seen so many homeless people on my way to work..."
"Same," Markham mutters under his breath, "The homelessness in this city is unlike anything I--I've ever seen."
Diego chimes in, "Yeah, ese. I was looking at some apartments cuz some vatos needed a place to lay low, and HOLY SHIT were the rents crazy- and it wasn't even like a fucking penthouse or anything. Just a regular 1 bedroom."
He shakes his head in disbelief, "I still can't get over how high everything is here. It's fuckin' insane, homes. And these rich busters keep building these fucking mega-mansions for themselves while the rest of us are just tryna make ends touch."
Marisol tells her boyfriend, "At least we have mi abuela's house as our Haven, D. If it weren't for that, I do not know how we...how we would survive." She looks down and her eyes get glassy.
Diego tells Markham a bit about what he does, "I don't got a fancy office job like my girl here, heh. Like I said last night, I do some volunteering to help out at the local community center, y'know, get it up and running so the peeps got something...nice to do around here."
Markham softly says, "It's the least you can do, I guess."
Marisol sourly scoffs and checks her watch, "The least we can do? It's the government's job to fix this shit! It's your job at the SEC to hold these pendejos accountable!"
Markham plainly tells her, "I'm just here to make sure that everybody plays fair and by the same rules. I'm not some kind of avenging angel about to bring down a flaming sword on anyone's neck."
"So you're just gonna let these pendejos walk around with all that money like nothing happened?!" Marisol angrily demands, her voice growing louder.
Diego calms her, "Easy, easy."
Markham sighs deeply, "Look, I don't know what impression you have of the SEC, but we're struggling too. Decades of cuts to our funding, lack of staff, and a bunch of other political and bureaucratic bullshit meddling have left us in a less-than-ideal state."
He continues, "This city and this country in general has a lot of problems, sure, but the SEC is doing everything they can with the hands they've been dealt. There's good people in my office who wanna do the right thing, but--"
Marisol snarks, "It's too 'complicated', or you're afraid of pissing off the wrong pendejo, tch."
"Yes and no. It's a bit more nuanced than that." the Baali dryly explains, "Sure, I've seen some really shitty things in my line of work and there's only so much that I can ignore, but sometimes--"
Diego fills in, "You have to let little the little piranhas go so you can...reel in the big kahunas. Yeah, I get it. I...get it. Plenty of vatos I help out have similar stories- they tried to do the right thing, but got busted up and royally screwed over in the system."
Marisol clicks her tongue, "Hm. Yeah. Let's see how long these 2 scumbags go around living the good life after Mr. Reed here busts them."
Markham shakes his head, "That's not how it works. I'll need solid evidence that proves criminality on the part of Mr. Donovan and his associates. Even with all the stuff I've gathered so far, I can't go to my superiors."
Diego leans forward and asks, "And how much have you gathered?"
"A lot, but it might not necessarily be the kind of stuff that'll lead to cuffs being slapped on either Mr. Donovan or Mr. Cho."
Marisol mutters, "You'll need mountains of evidence- the kind of shit that can only take decades. Decades which we Kindred have, but decades which these mortals don't."
Diego softly smiles, "She's right, homes. Those 2 busters have a rep in this city and it ain't a good one. You know who that Donovan guy's daddy is, right?"
Markham's eyes glaze over, "Hmm, yeah. I've heard about him- not exactly Time Magazine's Person Of The Year, that much is certain."
Diego proceeds to explain what little he's managed to learn about LDJ's dad, but this is mostly old news to Markham. Still, the Baali does thank the Gangrel for sharing what he knows.
Marisol looks at her watch and stands up. She smooths out the few creases in her clothing, adjusts her curly hair, and heads for the front door.
Diego tells his guest to wait for a minute of 2, "I'll be right back, OK?"
"Sure."
Diego follows Marisol to the front door, "Ready for another night, mi corazon? I am going to miss you. A lot, heh."
"You say that every night, D. I'm fine, I have a routine, I stick to it, keep my head down, mind my own business. That's it." At this point, her routine is practically baked into her undead being.
Diego puts his hands on Marisol's shoulders and looks deep into her eyes, "I'll uh...show our guest around. Maybe take him to that bodega to feed. Give him his 1st ever ride in a lowrider, heh."
Marisol lowers her voice and meets his gaze, "Just promise you'll be careful around him, D. I know what you said last night and all, but--"
Diego places a finger on Marisol's lips and reassures, "I know, I know. Markham seems like a--a decent guy, y'know. We should help him. It's what your abuela would've done, no?"
Marisol smiles fondly when her abuela is mentioned, but there's still a sadness that's apparent, "Sure. I just don't want those pendejos at Immigration showing up to our doorsteps 1 night, D."
"I know what you mean. Don't worry, he's not gonna snitch on us, OK?"
Diego kisses Marisol on the forehead and tells her, "Now, go on. I'll take good care of our guest."
Marisol grabs her purse and bike keys from the table in the foyer. She kisses her boyfriend on the cheek and makes her way over to where her scooter is parked- it's a black machine that's a bit scratched up on the sides.
Diego watches her go, the scooter whoosing away until it becomes nothing more than a pinprick of light in the distance. He sighs and closes the front door.
He walks back into the living room and finds Markham sitting there, staring down at his scuffed shoes.
The Gangrel gently claps his hands, "Well, it's just us vatos now."
The Baali replies, "I um...hope I didn't overstep any boundaries. Your Marisol can get a bit...testy, huh?"
Diego laughs, "Oh, haha. Yeah, she's always been like that- it's mainly the shit at work. She's good at heart, Markham. It's just that...this city can take its toll on even the best of us. You know what I'm saying?"
"Yeah, I do. I feel like I'm already starting to see that," Markham's eyes wander over, as if he's thinking about something far away.
The Feral snaps his fingers, "Hey, yo? So, any plans? I was thinking of showing you the sights around here. And if you're up for it, giving you a ride around town in a lowrider." He has a semi-expectant look plastered all over his face.
Markham gives his host a sideways look, eyes narrowed, "Now's not exactly the time for joyrides. Also, won't the other Gangrel get suspicious and tell Pedro? I wouldn't want to get you in any trouble."
Diego waves away his guest's concerns, "Pedro, Pedro, Pedro. He's a good homie, but he respects our territory as much as we respect him. If you're a guest in me and Marisol's Haven, then there's not much he can or will do about it. It's fine, trust me, OK?"
"If you say so. But, I still wanna do more digging into who tried to...get me last night."
"What else do you know about that buster?"
"He was a pro, that much was certain. Why?"
Diego smirks and strokes his chin, "It's a stretch, but I might know someone who uh...has her ears to the streets."
"Uh...?"
The Outlander faintly chuckles, "I didn't wanna mention her in front of Marisol."
"Why?"
"Ehh, reasons. What are your thoughts on the Brujah Clan?"
Markham stops to think, "Um...I dunno. I haven't met many to form a strong opinion in either direction, why? Is this 'her' you mentioned one of them?"
"Yeah, she's a Brujah, alright. She's also a..." he stops halfway through and looks around, like he's uncomfortable with something.
"What?" Markham asks, confused as to what the other Kindred is looking around for.
Diego looks at the ceiling and whispers, "She's also a prostitute, man."
"Oh."
Diego snickers, "Yeah. Her name's Roxanne, yeah, like that song from--"
Markham fills in, "The Police. Yeah, I've listened to it back when I was a fraud investigator for a small firm."
Diego's eyebrows shoot up, "What made you leave that for the SEC?"
"I guess I wanted a change and a chance to...do some good, I guess." One senses that Markham isn't being totally honest with Diego.
"And how's that working out for ya, huh?" the Gangrel sarcastically asks.
Markham shrugs, "I try. It's not easy. Especially in this new century."
"Hmm, tell me about it. So, whaddaya say, homes? We pay this puta (ES: prostitute) a visit, try to find out if she knows anything about the assassinos who might still be after your ass?"
"..."
Diego clicks his tongue, "The way I see it, you've got no other choice- I'm sure your bosses at the SEC won't be too thrilled about your latest...predicament, hmm? I've also heard about people monitoring phone calls and shit like that, so if you're gonna make any more calls to your superiors--"
Markham sighs, "I get it. You're right- they tried to kill a Federal Government employee, but I can't risk going to my boss about that without revealing my true nature."
"Mm-hmm."
Markham looks directly at the Gangrel and pointedly asks, "Why are you helping me?"
The Feral shrugs, "Because it's the right thing to do. It's what you would also do if our situations were reversed, right? RIGHT?" His eyes glint with a hopeful spark and he flashes a toothy grin.
Markham gulps and nods, "Yeah, of course. Of course. I don't mean to sound ungrateful or anything, I just--"
"Gringo like you not used to this kind of help, huh?"
"Yeah, something like that. Look, thank you for all your help, Diego. I'm--I'm really lucky to have met you and Marisol."
Diego shrugs and claps the Baali on the back, "Hey, don't mention it. Just try not to bring any crazy killers to our doorstep, huh? Still, if you do, stand back and let us deal with it- this house is all we have, man."
"I'll try to keep it as low-key as possible."
Diego chuckles, "You better! Now, c'mon. We'll take my truck, OK? We'll grab us some warm necks at this bodega I know- it's mostly dark and full of peeps to bite into, heh. You'll like it, trust me, homes."
Markham nods and follows his host to his truck.
On the way, Diego puts some Spanish rap music on, singing along and shaking his head to the beat. Markham is pretty indifferent to the music. The Baali doesn't say much, just listens and takes everything in.
In time, the duo arrive at the bodega. There's a few people milling about and lolling around. A man exits with a half-eaten hot pocket, another comes out with a fresh soda.
The 2 Kindred enter the bodega, which smells of meat, smoke, and other things. The lights are dim and there are a few TV's playing various channels.
The owner is a grumpy-looking fella with thinning hair, an unkempt beard, and bags under his eyes. His face looks like a storm cloud and he's smoking a cigarette. He looks annoyed by everyone and everything.
Diego waves to him and the guy nods back, "Eyyy, Javier!"
Javier's voice is hoarse and indifferent, "Diego. What now? Come to talk my head off again about politics or sports?" He seems to know the Gangrel rather well.
Diego chuckles, "Nah, nothing like that, homie. I'm just gonna take a look around with my friend here and I'll be out of your hair, haha."
Markham's shoes slide along the messy floor. He spots traces of blood and other fluids all over the place. He also spots some suspicious stains on the walls.
The lights flicker every so often and there's a smell of meat, smoke, and tobacco that lingers in the air. It does tickle the dead nostrils of the 2 vampires.
Markham stops at the commercial display fridge and looks at all the drinks available- alcohol, juice, soda, and so on. He largely feels indifferent towards no longer being able to partake in mortal food and drink.
Diego nudges the Baali and joins him, "Yeah, even I kinda miss regular bebidas (ES: drinks). Ah, well..." he trails off and looks around the bodega as some kids enter the place and immediately head for the snack aisle.
A kid is already looking at some chips and his older sister is getting something to drink from the fridge. The gangly older kid looks at the Feral and Markham with curiosity.
Diego smiles at her and takes Markham aside, "C'mon, let's go."
"Hmm." Markham has this distant look on his face, as if he's trying to piece something together in his head.
"Yo? You still in there?" Diego gently snaps his fingers.
Markham comes back and nods, "Y--Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, I was uh--never mind."
Diego gestures to the back, "Andale, andale (ES: Come on, come on), I need to bite into someone...and fast, heh."
"Me too." Markham can feel his inner Beast roaring and demanding satiation of the sanguine variety- sodas and hot pockets ain't gonna cut it. Not anymore, and not evermore.
Such is the bloody (pun very much intended) price of immortality.
The back area of this bodega is strewn with trash, discarded cigarette butts, and broken beer bottles. The concrete ground is cracked, and a rat scampers past the 2 Kindred, looking at them with its beady little eyes.
Diego spots a woman in a skimpy dress making suggestive gestures to a man in a fancy suit. He turns around and explains, "Yeah, a whole lotta prostitutes around here. Roxanne's just 1 of them- plenty of peeps willing to pay for it, too."
Markham dryly states, "Hmm. Desperate people do desperate things."
Diego adds, "Right now, we have a different kind of desperation. Andale, andale. I dunno how much longer I can hold off my Beast from ugh..." his eyes grow big and he looks around, a little embarrassed.
Markham quietly suggests, "Uh...you need any help pulling someone over?"
Diego's eyes nearly bulge out of he responds with short growls and grunts. He heads over to a nearby corner, where a woman is waiting, a cheap cigarette dangling between her lips.
He yanks her to a dark corner, subdues her, and bites into a neck with such fury that Markham can hear that gross sound of fangs piercing flesh and the gurgles of the victim. She tries to scream, but Diego covers her mouth with his hairy hand.
Markham spots a young man in casual wear rifling through the dumpster. The Baali sneaks up behind him, pulls his neck back, and bites into it. Blood flows and the young man's eyes roll back. He tries to fight it, but he is no match for the Baali's preternatural grip.
Markham takes only what is needed, as does Diego. Even if it's a little less than needed, it's enough to satiate the eternal Hunger that rages within every Kindred of every Clan and of every Bloodline, regardless of "age" and Generation.
After a few moments, the 2 Kindred rise and their eyes have a bit more color to them. Their skin is now flushed with some color and their eyes are alive. They wipe their mouths and take in the sight of the unconscious humans before them.
They lick the puncture wounds shut. The mortals in question are, thankfully, still alive. Their breathing is labored, yet there seems to be a look reflective of...satisfaction on their tired faces.
Diego adjusts his clothes, flashes an uncertain look at the chick he bit into, and quickly walks back to his truck. Markham does the same. When he's back in the truck, the Gangrel turns to the Baali, "So, you good now?"
"Mm-hmm."
"You ever uh...get grossed out by it?"
"By what?"
The Feral gesticulates, "The whole blood thing, man. Does it make you squirm? It makes ME squirm."
"Sometimes. It's what we are now, it's what we have to do to...survive. It's not like we're given much of a choice in the matter."
"Hmm." Diego starts up his truck and drives for a few minutes until a prostitute approaches his truck at a traffic stop. She suggestively pouts and Diego greets her, "Hey, 'sup!"
The sex worker looks to be in her early-20s. She's wearing fishnet stockings, a leopard-patterned jacket that's a bit worn for wear, a pair of ripped jeans, and some sneakers that have seen better times. There are dark circles around her eyes, the result of many sleepless nights.
Her long and stringy hair is greasy and matted and her brown eyes are glazed over. Her lipstick is smeared and her eyeshadow is mismatched.
"Lookin' for a good time, boys?" Her voice is equal parts velvety, equal parts hoarse and raspy. The 2 vampires can tell this is not the 1st time she's done this. It won't be the last, either.
The sex worker looks at Markham and loosely smiles, "I could show you a good time, mister."
Markham feels awkward, but bottles it all down. He directly asks her, "We're looking for a Roxanne. You know her?"
The lady of the night lets out a long, drawn-out whistle, "Ooh, Roxy, huh? You got tastes, huh?"
Diego leans forward in his seat, "Eh...something like that. You know where she's at?"
She pouts and moues, "Aren't I good enough for the both of ya?"
Markham impatiently says, "We're not interested in fucking you. We're looking for information."
Diego calms the Baali down, "Hey, slow down, hombre, slow down. What my uh...good friend here meant is that we're actually looking for something a bit different. Y'know?"
"Well, whatever it is, Roxy could be the one to help you out, I dunno. She knows everybody around here, she's tight with a lot of people, too. C'mon, guys, I can do everything Roxanne can do and--"
The Feral stops her, "It's...alright. We're not interested."
The prostitute's expression changes, "Then, what the fuck do ya want?"
Markham sighs deeply, "Do you or do you not know where Roxanne is right now?"
"Psssh, I'm not her fucking mommy, OK, mister?"
Markham remains unfazed and almost withdrawn, "Do you know what she looks like, at least?"
The sex worker dryly gives the 2 Kindred a vague description of the Brujah sex worker. They thank her for her time and drive off when the light finally turns green. As they drive off, the woman sticks her tongue out, flips the bird, and screams something indeterminable.
Markham doesn't give a damn. Diego just chuckles and shakes his head. Sadly, in this city, it's par for the course. The story of that sex worker is just a single line in a long book of human tragedies that spans volume after volume after volume.
Markham remarks, "I've never seen a prostitute so desperate before."
Diego shakes his head, "Welcome to Flimont City, homes. Out here, it REALLY is dog eat dog."
"How do you manage?"
"Well, as I'm sure you're aware, as Kindred we don't need no 'normal' food and drink, so not having much in terms of a huge-ass grocery bill is a big help. That said, there are still plenty of ways to get screwed." Diego's voice sounds rather detached.
Markham is curious, "Like...?"
"Like, um...a bunch of shady financial speculator types buying up swathes of land and planning to build shitty stadiums and theme parks that nobody fucking asked for. Seriously, the kinds of shit those powerful pendejos wanna do to this 'hood is fucking ludicrous, man!"
"I'm sorry," is all Markham can say at this moment. The city's night breeze sweeps his dark hair. The Baali is quiet for a few moments, his mind seemingly elsewhere.
Markham thinks about his life pre-Embrace and post-Embrace. How much has changed? Too much, but also not enough.
The world "changed," sure, but he just went along for the ride and didn't question certain things. However, the cracks in his façade are beginning to show.
The 2 vampires ride around the city for the next few hours. Diego picks up a few informal day laborers (the vatos usually hanging around Home Depots and Walmart parking lots, selling their labor power for scraps) and offers to get them some food and drop them back to their homes.
He does this expecting nothing in return. Markham simply remains as a fly on the wall, as it were, letting the others do a vast majority of the talking.
After the last guy, barely 18, has been dropped off at his home, Diego takes Markham to go see some lowriders and maybe give him a ride in 1. Baby's first lowrider.
In the Prairie Ridge, Apartment 303...
Mauve has already waken up from her day-long slumber. She looks around her Haven and seems quite impressed with how Diana was able to nicely clean everything up and get it looking great despite all the wild partying last night.
She walks around the place and takes in the sights, smells, and sounds. Her enhanced hearing helps her detect the subtle sounds of crickets chirping and the faint sounds of wind rushing through the leaves in nearby trees.
She bathes, looks at herself in the mirror. Still as dull and baggy-eyed as ever. The Malkavian wears a simple t-shirt and shorts and prepares to head out to sate her Hunger.
As she's locking her door, Paul calls out to her, "HEY! HEY! Where the fuck do you think you're going?!" He has this wild look in his eyes- his pupils are dilated and his eyes have a redness to them. His hair is unkempt and his shirt is full of stains. He's also very twitchy, even more so than usual.
Mauve looks askance at him, "I'm uh...heading out for a quick walk, Mr. Cho."
His hands shake and he commands her, "Open the door. Now."
Mauve clutches her keys and takes a step back, "Are you OK, Paul? You don't look so--"
Paul snaps at her and rushes forward. He attempts to grab the keys from the Malk's cold hands, but she swiftly moves out of the way and puts the keys back in her pocket.
Mauve gives him a look of concern, "Paul, you really don't look so good."
"SHUT THE FUCK UP, BITCH! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR! NOW!" He raises his voice so much that a neighbor pokes her head out and gives him a dirty look.
Mauve stands firm and tries to reason with him, "Paul, you really need to calm down and--"
"SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT THE FUCK UP!" His entire body shivers and his teeth are chattering. He keeps making these jerky movements that Mauve hasn't seen before.
The Malkavian firmly tells him, "Look, Paul, if you just stay calm and don't lose your cool, then I can--"
Paul has had enough, "Gimme the keys, bitch!" He approaches her with menace punctuating every step.
Mauve backs away until she hits the wall behind her. Paul leers at her and he goes for the keys again. This time, he gets a grip on them and yanks them out of her cold hand. She stifles a gasp and Paul goes to open her door.
Feeling frustrated, he tries the keys over and over again until Mauve sheepishly offers, "It's...the other way, Mr. Cho."
Paul grunts and makes some other noises, "Fuck you." He manages to get the door open after a few seconds of trying to get it to work.
He enters Mauve's Haven and begins tearing it apart, looking for something. He tosses things left and right. Just when Diana cleaned this place up, and this bozo comes in to tear it apart!
Mauve quietly observes, "Um...you OK, Paul? Did you forget something last night?"
(He forgot the blow that Luciano stashed in "a safe place").
He ignores her and continues tossing things all over the place. He doesn't seem to be satisfied with what he's not finding, though.
Mauve tries to contain the situation by following him from room to room and asking, "Was it your phone?"
Paul growls and grunts and tells her, "Stay back, bitch. Stay the fuck back!"
Mauve holds her hands up in surrender, palms facing outward. Despite being distracted by her Hunger, she's more perturbed by Paul's erratic behavior. She's also a little scared by him being all mean and erratic and jumpy.
Mauve tries to ask again, "If it's not your phone, then what is it?"
Paul stops in the middle of the room and throws something of a manbaby tantrum. He stomps on the floor, curses like a sailor, and runs his hands through his hair. He looks like a real mess.
His eyes are red, his face is covered in sweat, and he's breathing like a bull about to charge.
Mauve gulps and looks VERY afraid. She demurely shuffles herself to her bedroom door and stands by it.
She quietly asks, "Is it your uh...cocaine?"
Paul stops in his tracks and looks at her like a deer caught in headlights, "W--What? YOU! You fucking know where it is, huh? You--you been helping yourself to my fucking candy?! HUH? I paid $8500 for that shit! $8500!"
Mauve's face falls, "I--I don't--um...I don't know where it is, Mr. Cho."
Paul bitterly spits, "Don't 'Mr. Cho' me! You've been burying your beak in it, huh? Haven't you?"
Of course, a vampire won't feel anything when doing drugs, but Mauve doesn't pursue that particular line for obvious reasons. She merely shakes her head in denial, "No, no, no. No, I--I really don't know where it is, I swear. I don't."
"BULLSHIT! GET OUTTA MY WAY! I wanna search YOUR room now! It's MY fucking stash that I fucking paid for with MY FUCKING HARD-EARNED MONEY!" He tries to enter her room, but she moves to block him.
Mauve stands firm and raises her voice, "You will not enter my room, Paul! This is MY Haven and I--" She catches herself before saying anymore.
Whoops.
Paul doesn't care and cuts her off by pushing her aside with surprising force. With her vampiric strength, she could snap him like a twig, but she remains far too fearful and far too uncertain of the situation.
She doesn't want to hurt Paul and make Luciano angry at her. Also, she can't risk this arrangement they've got going on here, so she does the only thing she can think of- let the dope fiend search her room.
Her room is the only place in this Haven that holds a part of her. Everything else in her apartment is just for the sake of maintaining appearances and keeping up with the Joneses.
Paul continues his search, tearing open drawers and cupboards, emptying out dressers, and flipping over cushions. Like a madman, he rifles through her undergarments, bras, socks, and other stuff like that.
He finds nothing. There's no pound of cocaine hidden in the bathroom or the bedroom, nor is it hidden anywhere else. He goes back out to the living room area and looks under the sofa.
Nothing.
Paul mutters, spit flying out, "Where the fuck did he stash it?!"
Mauve sheepishly asks, "Did--Did you um...try looking in the kitchen?"
Paul glares at her and storms over to the kitchen, where he finds nothing. No 1 pound of pure blow stashed behind the fridge or behind the oven, not even hidden inside the pantry.
Despite not having fed, Mauve figures it might be worth a try to (secretly) activate her Auspex Discipline so she can help find Paul's mojo and get him the fuck outta her hair.
She moves aside, her eyes changing to a swirl of colors. She quietly whispers to herself, "Where did it go? Where's his coke?"
After a few minutes of searching, she finally sees a faint glow in the distance- a glow that only she can see. Paul continues making a mess of everything, while the woman he barely pays attention to begins to zero in on the location of his prized stash.
Mauve finally finds what she's looking for- it's deep inside an overhead kitchen cupboard, shoved all the way behind oregano seasoning bottles, salt and pepper shakers, and some other stuff used to flavor food.
After deactivating her Auspex, she tells Paul, "It's in here."
Paul frantically asks, "Which one?"
Mauve gingerly points to it and Paul immediately rushes over. He shoves her aside and takes down the bottles and jars that are in his way. 1 slips from his grasp and shatters all over the floor!
He finally finds his precious pound of coke! He holds it up in the air like it's some kind of trophy, laughing maniacally and dancing around like a fool.
Mauve looks down at the shards of broken glass and oregano flakes that now litter her floor. She looks up at Paul with a weary and disheartened look on her face.
She feels so horrible on the inside. The Malkavian shakily asks, "You gonna clean that up? I--I mean you broke it, so--"
Paul scoffs, "Fuck you! It's your joint! Luciano pays the rent, he pays the bills. He does enough. Clean it up your fucking self! Jesus, bums like you ought to be a little more grateful for all the shit that guys like us do, hmm?"
Mauve, not intent on antagonizing the best friend of her benefactor, finds a broom and dust pan. With a sad and defeated expression on her face, she begins cleaning up the mess that another adult made in her kitchen.
Paul goes to the front door, pausing for a moment to turn back and tell her, "Thanks for nothing, bitch! You're lucky you don't get cut off, or else we'd throw you outta this fucking place even before you had a chance to blink! Hah!"
He exits, slamming the door behind him. Mauve sighs deeply and continues cleaning the kitchen. As she's sweeping, her Beast continues to roar and scratch within her, almost like a cat repeatedly scratching at a door.
The Malkavian's stomach grumbles and she feels the need to feed intensify. She needs to get outta here and find some blood. NOW!
So, she does just that. She puts the cleaning aside and goes downstairs. She's hit with some of that polluted city breeze when she exits her apartment complex.
She goes through the usual rigmarole of finding a suitable person, isolating them, biting into them, not killing them (preferable), and then licking those bite marks shut.
Once her Beast has calmed down, she goes straight back to her Haven. She doesn't stop for anyone or anything. At the edge of her apartment's entrance, her eyes gloss over to the homeless folks that are there, as per usual.
Mauve stops for a moment and turns to look at them. Some are huddled together under a single blanket, while others are all by themselves.
She looks at the handmade bracelet around her wrist and wonders to herself if that homeless teenage girl she was friends with is doing OK, but in a city as cruel as Flimont, she can't be so sure.
Still, in her undead heart of hearts, Mauve Lilac hopes that that girl at least gets the help she so desperately needs. To think that it hasn't even been 3 months since Luciano offered her this...job (for lack of any better terms) and fancy place to stay in. And now, it's the only home she knows.
She goes back up to her place, exchanges quick and curt pleasantries with a few neighbors, and finally reaches her apartment. She unlocks the door and enters, locking the door behind her.
With a resigned and distant look on her face, she trudges to her room, puts everything back where it belongs, and finishes tidying up the rest of her place. She then collapses on the sofa, already feeling exhausted. Not from manual labor, but from the weight on her shoulders.
She lets out a heavy sigh and closes her eyes. Mauve doesn't permit her mind to wander too far, lest she get dragged in to the Malkavian Madness Network- the psychic link shared by all of the Children of Malkav regardless of where they are in the world or who they are.
Hell, it doesn't even matter if they've been reduced to ashes, their minds can still be heard in the Cobweb and their memories (in some form or the other) continue to "live" on. It's an interconnected web that can never truly be cut because there's no physical space to attack.
It's just...there. It's always been there. And it'll always be there.
Once out of her mini reverie, Mauve gets off the sofa and begins to work on enriching her benefactor through her unique relationship with the numbers- she turns on her laptop and gets to work. Her Malkavian mind works in unusual ways.
Back to Markham and Diego...
Diego parks his pickup truck near a random garage. Markham follows his Gangrel buddy, who knocks on the door and greets the owner, "Yo, Raul! What's good, homie?"
Raul's face is smudged with motor oil, grease, and grime. His gray shirt is also covered in oil, as are his jeans and shoes. The man smiles widely, revealing sharp fangs with traces of blood on them. He gives Diego a big hug.
Raul nods over to the Baali, standing in the corner of this well-lit garage, "Who's the gringo?"
Diego makes the necessary introductions, "Markham. He's us, well not us-us, but us. Know what I mean? He's a good friend of mine." Markham waves and says nothing.
Raul nods and grins, "Cool, cool. Hey, Markham. Good to meet you, ese. I know a government stiff from a mile away, haha!"
Raul looks to be in his late-20s. He has some stubble on his chin, his chin-length hair is a little messy and slicked back, and he has a few tattoos on his forearms. His jeans are baggy, and his gray shirt is stained and a little torn. He looks like the quintessential mechanic.
Markham looks confused, "How did you know--?"
Raul heartily laughs, "Ah, you government stiffs all have this...distinctive stance. The way you handle yourself and behave and stuff. Y'know, I used to work for the Federal Government, too." He stops there.
Diego fills in, "Yeah, Markham is uh...new around these parts." With that, he fills his fellow Gangrel in on Mr. Reed's current predicament and their current quest to find Roxanne.
By the end of it all, Raul smirks and wipes his hands with a tattered cloth, "Ah, shit. That's fucked up, ese. Fucked. Up. It ain't right." The 2 vampires can see some sympathy on the Gangrel's face.
Raul goes on, "Man, when I was working for the IRS, shit never got this tense, haha. All the shit I saw and experienced, it was a helluva ride, man."
Markham's eyebrows go up, "What did you do there?"
"Well, I was an auditor, basically. Then, fangs pierced my neck and things changed...now, I just fix up lowriders and shit like that. It's not exactly retirement, y'know. But, it has its moments."
Markham simply nods and doesn't say much.
Diego whistles when he sees the shiny red lowrider that Raul's working on. It's a classic and it's in beautiful condition. He looks at his buddy with wide eyes, "Damn, son! I'm impressed."
Raul smiles and proudly shows it off, "This, my friends, is a 1964 Chevrolet Impala. Got it at an auction for pennies on the dollar, haha! Took a few weeks to get the thing fixed and looking like this."
Markham walks around the car, looking at the paint job and the interior. There's a radio and some speakers. The leather seats have been restored and they're nice and new. The rims are chrome and shiny.
Raul tells Diego, "Wanna go for a ride, ese?"
Diego bites his lower lip and looks at the Baali, "Yeah, I wanted to give our Gringo friend here his 1st ever lowrider experience." He winks and claps his guest on the shoulder.
Markham shrugs, "Why not?"
Raul laughs and tosses the key to his fellow Feral, "Don't break her, don't scratch her, don't crash her."
Diego hops in, puts the keys in, and smiles in satisfaction when the car's engines purr to life. Raul goes out and stands next to the Baali. He leans over and asks, "So, how long you been a Kindred?"
"Since the 1970s."
"Heh, you're still new, then. A Neonate. So, how have these 30 or so years of immortality been treating you, my friend?"
"I can't complain."
"Hmm, a man of few words, huh? So, Baali, hmm? Unlike the rest of these Cholos, I don't got no beef with you...cuz I don't own no pets- too much to maintain and the prices of dog food? In this economy? Oh hell nah."
Markham points out, "I don't have anything to do with the other Baali here."
Raul clicks his tongue, "Easy, ese, easy. Looking for that Brujah puta, huh?"
"Something like that."
Raul shakes his head and snickers to himself, "Yeah, I've...been with her."
Markham lifts an eyebrow at that statement, but he doesn't comment.
"Oh yeah, she's a good time, man. A little on the pricey side, but well worth it, heh. The Brujah might be your best bet for finding the scum who tried to off you. You know that Flimont City has got loads of unsolved murders, right?"
Markham dryly responds, "Yeah. I've heard. So, there's what, an organized...group carrying out the hits on behalf of the city's more well-heeled individuals?"
Raul chuckles, "Summin' like that, ese. It's just...well, you've seen the city and all its...dirty little secrets, eh?"
"Not all of it."
Diego is busy getting a feel for the car. His hands are tightly wrapped around the steering wheel. He fiddles with the radio when Raul hollers out, "Hey! Hands off the knobs! I still haven't finished putting in the new stereo system, yet!"
Diego grins and yells back, "C'mon, can't a vato just--"
Raul shouts, "NO! DON'T PUSH THE BUTTON!"
Diego raises his hands in mock surrender and goes back to revving the engine, the sounds like a symphony orchestra to his ears.
Raul picks up from where he left off, "Like I was saying: this city ain't a kind place to most busters on the best of nights. On the worst of nights..." he stops and shudders a little.
"Hmm. I hear you."
Raul continues, "If someone is willing to pay enough, then the hitters will come in and make sure the dirty deed is done, y'know? Hell, from what I heard, even little kids ain't off the menu. There was this pretty grisly series of killings back in um...'97."
Markham softly growls and shakes his head, saying nothing.
Raul sniffs, "Just watch your back out there, ese. You're playing on someone else's turf- thankfully this hood's been spared from the worst of these cocky speculators and their insane schemes, but I can't guarantee that it'll always remain this way."
"Will do," Markham takes the Gangrel's advice and walks over to the lowrider. He gets in the passenger seat and looks a bit uneasy about the whole thing; much still weighs on his mind, though.
Diego puts his foot on the accelerator and exits the garage. As he's leaving, he screams out, "WHOO-HOO!"
Raul reminds his fellow Outlaw, "Not a scratch, not a dent, not a ding!"
"YEAH, YEAH!"
The 2 vampires take off. Markham is quiet for a moment before he tells Diego, "We need to find Roxanne."
Diego has 1 hand on the steering wheel, while the other sticks out the window. He has a huge grin on his face and a twinkle in his eye, "Yeah, we will, we will. Let's just...enjoy this little moment, OK?"
"Hmm." Markham looks at the city go by. The lights go on, the cars go past, and the people walk about. There are a lot of folks out and about, even though it's almost 2 AM.
On the cruise throughout the city, Diego informs Markham, "Y'know, lowriding is illegal in the state of California? The California Vehicle Code, pfft."
He growls and curses, "Fucking pendejos don't want us having fun, being human, or just existing, huh?"
"Maybe."
The wind continues to sweep Markham's hair and Diego's. They drive around, sometimes pulling up next to other lowriders and greeting each other.
On the way, Diego does the cool lowrider thing- on a somewhat-empty stretch of road, he pulls down on something and begins bouncing the lowrider.
Markham feels awkward, yet a tad bit curious about the whole experience. Diego is grinning ear to ear, his fangs gleaming in the bright moonlight.
"Aw, hell yeah!"
A few regular cars pass by and some stop to check out the lowrider. The drivers and passengers give the Gangrel and his friend thumbs-up and some friendly jeers and heckling.
It's all in good fun. Diego is a master at handling the car and Markham is just along for the ride.
Diego pulls off a few more bounces, the car makes a "thuwmp!" sound and goes up and down, and the Gangrel howls into the night.
After the last bounce, he drives normally and turns to Markham, "So, how was that? Not too bad, huh?"
Markham regains his composure, "It was...something. I felt something swirling around inside me."
"Hahahahahahahahaha! Yeah, it do be like that, homes. It do be like that."
Baby's first lowrider was...good. It was different from Markham's usual experiences (which isn't much to begin with) and it was rather fun.
Despite being cold and withdrawn, he felt some kind of spark when bouncing along the street, especially since Diego was having a great time.
The 2 Kindred cruise for another hour. They drive down streets, make turns, and even stop to ask a few prostitutes about Roxanne. A man in very loose clothing and a bulky fur coat tells the duo where Roxanne usually hangs out.
With this info, the 2 vampires decide to look into it tomorrow. For now, Diego dutifully returns this lovely car to Raul. Raul looks it over, strokes his chin a few times (for dramatic effect), and shrugs, "Well, you didn't mess her up. Good."
"Thanks, homes." Diego gives his buddy a big hug and they bump fists.
Markham stands by the side and waits. Diego bids farewell to Raul and rejoins the Baali.
Raul hollers out, "Don't be a stranger, Markham! If Diego or Marisol ever get tired of you, come by and we can work some kind of a deal for your living arrangements, eh?"
Markham smiles slightly and plainly waves to him. Raul laughs and slams the door shut.
Diego turns to Markham, "Well, what now?"
"Tomorrow, I follow the lead. I don't want you getting involved in this any further, Diego."
Diego side-eyes the Baali, "Why?"
Markham stifles a sigh, "Because it isn't your concern. It's mine- my case, my mess to get out of. Don't get me wrong- you've been a great help and you've shown me a lot, but...this is the part where you have to stand back and let me handle this."
Diego clicks his tongue, "That's the problem with Gringos like you- you think you're the lone heroes of some shitty cowboy movie where you have to do it all by yourself, huh? You're not. And this shit is a lot more dangerous than any of the cases you've probably dealt with before, ese."
Markham dryly responds, "It doesn't matter. I just...don't want you or Marisol, or anyone else for that matter, getting caught in the crossfire."
Diego lightly smacks Markham's shoulder, "Tch. We're Gangrel, homes. We're The Clan of the Beast, we can handle a couple of busters who try some funny shit with us, eh? Besides, I've lived in this city for a long time and I know it better than you do."
Markham shakes his head and looks down at the sidewalk.
Diego presses the point, "Let me tell you this: mi abuela always used to say that when you find a good friend, you stick with them. Through the thick and the thin. No matter what, homie."
Markham continues walking, remaining as wordless and withdrawn as always. The mention of a "friend" does bring up memories from his past, memories that have been buried and suppressed. Something begins to resurface...
"Ten-Hut! Markham, you're on point."
"Yes, sir!"
"Remember, you're going with these fine men into battle, soldier. These men trust you and you trust 'em. Do NOT fuck up, understood?"
"Understood, sir."
Markham's dressed in football pads and a helmet. His eyes are fierce and determined, but he's also quite afraid.
"You'll be fine, son. I'll be watching from the sidelines."
"Mr. Jenkins, I..."
"Just go out there and give it the best you got, kid."
The young Markham swallows the fear and apprehension building in his throat. He blinks a few times.
"Now, GO!"
"HOO-AH!"
"HOO-AH!"
"Hoo-AH!"
"Hoo-Ah!"
"Hoooooooo-ahhhh!"
A few others in similar football uniforms smack Markham on the back, as a little pre-game motivation, and rush out into the stadium. It's...packed. The sounds of trumpets being blown are no match for the wild and raucous cheering that erupts. The field is neat and bathed in cool, bright lights.
Amongst the cheering (and some booing) faces in the crowd, there she is...
She's sitting somewhere near the front, flanked by her mom and dad- Markham's parents. Her face is round, slightly freckled, her eyes are gray (just like Markham's). She has a soft smile on her face, like a good luck charm.
She wore her long and black hair down on that particular afternoon. Her clothes are simple and modest- a plaid shirt with some dark dungarees.
She waves and mouths, "Good luck, little brother."
Markham sheepishly waves at her and smiles.
Coach Jenkins claps Markham on the back and reminds him, "Remember what we talked about. I believe in you, soldier. So does Daniella over there."
Daniella, yes, that was her name. Some called her Dani. Daniella Reed, Markham Reed's older sister, his confidant, and yes, his friend.
Just then, her face begins to morph and contort into something monstrous. Markham gasps, his eyes wide open. Daniella begins to get crushed and mashed under something unseen, but overwhelmingly powerful.
"AAHH!" Markham gasps loudly and stops in his tracks.
Diego continues walking on the sidewalk, yapping, "Look, man, you can't take these bastards down alone, and if you try to do it solo, then it's only gonna end up badly. Badly for you and badly for those poor folks. So, if you're gonna do something stupid and get your ass kicked, then let me come along and make sure you don't fall too hard, hmm?"
The Gangrel turns on his heel and sees Markham standing there, with a distant and sorrowful look in his eye. His mouth is slightly agape, and his eyes are focused on something only he can see. Markham doesn't appear to be here in body. He's...somewhere else.
For the moment at least.
He snaps out of it and looks around, mouth still agape, "I..."
Diego puts his hand on the Baali's shoulder and gently inquires, "You doing OK, homes? You kinda went...blank there for a sec." He gestures with his head towards his pickup truck and walks over. Markham follows, not saying anything. He's still stunned and still a little shaken.
Diego unlocks the car and gets in. Markham climbs into the passenger seat and avoids eye contact with his Feral buddy. Diego starts the engine, looks at Markham for a second, and pulls off.
"You uh...you doing alright, homes? Did I say something?"
Markham gulps and shakes his head, "No, no, I just remembered something."
"Oh! Like what?"
Markham sharply exhales, "The circumstances surrounding my Embrace...and Re-Embrace were traumatizing. My memories are so--so jumbled up, my emotions so confused. I don't think I'll ever really...fully understand or fully grasp the...circumstances."
For Mr. Reed, it is quite like a black hole of uncertainty. A void, an endless void.
Diego slowly and contemplatively nods, keeping his eyes fixed on the road, "Mm-hmm. Unlife can be tough, heh. So, like I was saying- we got your back. You don't have to fight through this shit alone, y'know."
"I know, I know, it's just that I don't want you or Marisol getting hurt or losing that Haven of yours."
The Outrider clicks his tongue and smoothly takes a right turn, "Tch. Don't baby us, homes. We are perfectly capable of taking care of ourselves. Did you know that we repelled a bunch of Second Inquisition-affiliated white supremacists back in '95?"
Markham's eyebrows knit together and he looks confused.
Diego fills him in, "We did. The 5th Street Cholos sent those pendejos running like the scum that they are."
"SI-backed white supremacists? Since when?"
Diego bitterly chuckles and hits the brakes when the lights turn red at the intersection. A few cars stop alongside them. Diego answers, "Yeah, from what I could gather, those SI pendejos were experimenting with using loco militia types, white nationalists, and other crazies to uh..."
Markham interjects, "Hunt you down?"
The Gangrel corrects him, "Hunt US down. Yeah, that was pretty much the whole plan." The lights turn green and Diego steps on the accelerator, "They even managed to destroy a few of our people. Fuckin' assholes." The last bit of his response came out as a soft growl.
"How?"
"The SI made sure those busters was packing some mad heat, homes. You ever seen a man shouting the most racist shit imaginable while clad in body armor and wielding a flamethrower? Cuz I have, and let me tell ya...it was pretty crazy. In the end, they got repelled."
"They got repelled, huh?"
"Oh, they got the fuck beat outta them. But I'd like to sit here, look you in the eyes, and tell you it was a great success."
Markham shifts in his seat, "You lost some people? How many?"
"We lost A LOT of good Cholos." The Baali looks to the driver, but the Outlaw's face remains unreadable, save for the twitchy eyelid.
Markham observes, "Something happened?"
Diego pulls over and stops at the side of the road. He fiddles with the radio and the music starts playing, drowning out the sounds of the night and the dense traffic.
The Gangrel shakes his head and leans back against the seat. His eyes are closed and he sighs, "It was the first time I killed someone."
"Jesus."
"Haha, yeah. It was some skinny white kid, 18-19 maybe, with swastika tats on his fucking arm. He cornered Marisol and--and he--he was about to--" Diego stops and grits his teeth, shaking his head. His knuckles turn white from gripping the steering wheel too tight.
The car goes quiet for a few seconds. The driver side window is open. Markham doesn't need to breathe, but it's comforting to him, like the night breeze sweeping his hair to and fro.
Diego stammers and his lips quaver, "He was dousing her in kerosene, he was about to light the match when--when something came over me and I--"
Markham interrupts, placing his hand on Diego's tensed-up shoulder, "It's alright, Diego. You did what you had to do to save the person you love."
Diego doesn't say anything. His eyes are glossed over and he's staring off into the distance, small droplets of blood trickling down. He takes a few moments to calm down and relax.
The Feral continues, "By the time I came around, his body was there, but it was all mushy and messy, like someone had taken a fucking sledgehammer and beaten his ass into a pulp." His fingers drum on the steering wheel.
Markham slowly mutters, "The Beast took over."
"Hmph, yeah. I comfort myself with that same...thought every now and then."
Diego closes his eyes and leans against the steering wheel, the horn beeps for a few seconds, before the Gangrel gets himself together and goes on, "In the aftermath, we drove the rest of 'em out and haven't been hit ever since. Shit."
"Hmm."
The Gangrel starts his vehicle up and wordlessly drives along. After a few minutes, they're back home. Diego parks and sees a woman leaning against a sleek red Mustang convertible.
Sheriff Velma DuPont is dressed in a trench coat, flats, and a blue blouse with a black skirt. Her hair is tied in a high up do and her lipstick is dark red. Her arms are folded and she's in the middle of conversing with Marisol.
She looks over at the 2 approaching Kindred and asks, "How you doing?" Her tone is smooth and friendly.
Diego flashes a winning smile, "Doin' great. Just cruising around, showing my friend here a good time."
Sheriff Velma lifts an eyebrow and smirks, "'Friend'? So soon, hmm? How you holding up, Markham? This Feral giving you any trouble?"
"I'm fine, and Diego has been a good host."
Marisol greets Diego and takes him aside, "We'll be inside, err...Sheriff."
The Ventrue Sheriff lazily waves her hand, but she firmly warns, "You're lucky I'm letting you off with a warning this time, Marisol. Next time, I won't be so lenient, darling."
Diego cocks his head, "What? Whoa, what happened?"
Sheriff Velma explains, "Your girlfriend here was caught feeding on a runaway vessel set aside for the Ventrue earlier tonight. Of course, she couldn't have known, but if this happens again, I'm afraid I'll have to get more serious."
Diego's eyes go wide and he turns to Marisol, "What the hell?! I told you to be careful!"
Marisol calms her boyfriend down, "Relax, D. Relax. It was a mistake. Besides, would you rather I ignore my Hunger and Frenzy all over the city like a maniac, hmm?"
Sheriff Velma shakes her head, "Then, I'd have no choice but to put you down."
Diego gulps and his eyes widen a little bit, "It--it won't come to that. Please, uh...forgive us?"
The Sheriff faintly chuckles and looks at Markham, "Oh, I do like it when they squirm. Luckily, I'm in a forgiving mood tonight, but don't let this happen again." She gives Marisol a stern look.
Marisol repeatedly nods, "Yes, yes, yes. Sorry, sorry, sorry." She takes Diego by the arm and leads him inside. Markham watches the 2 Kindred go and then turns to face Sheriff Velma.
She looks the Baali up and down, "Markham, how have you been faring so far?"
"Good."
Sheriff Velma side-eyes him, smirking, "Hmm. Good is...better than what I was expecting, all things considered."
Markham lifts his chin, "What's that supposed to mean?"
Sheriff Velma points out, "You killed a man last night- a professional killer, no less. His buddies aren't the forgive-and-forget type, if you catch my drift. Maybe wonder boy LDJ really wants you out of the picture, huh?"
"Yeah, that's what I'm going with, but I still have a job to do and I can't let it be derailed by this."
"Derailed, huh?" Sheriff Velma looks off in the distance for a moment, before refocusing her attention on Markham, "You know, I understand your position here. You've got your bosses at the SEC who need results, but at the same time, you can't tell them...everything, right?"
Markham nods, "Something like that. What do you know about a Brujah prostitute named Roxanne?"
The Sheriff lets out a long whistle, "Damn. This is hardly the time to be getting laid, Reed."
The Baali sighs and glowers at her, "No, I'm not interested in that. She might have info on the group that hitman used to be a part of."
"Hmm. From what I've heard, she's a busy gal, gallivanting around Flimont's seedier parts, parts that I wouldn't normally visit. Just ask around and someone's bound to know where to find her on any given night."
In an almost passive-aggressive way, the Baali responds, "I know."
The Ventrue Sheriff picks up on this and smugly smirks, "Don't get cocky, Reed. Remember: you're a guest in this Domain. At any time, me or Prince Antonio could kick you out. It'd be a shame if you had to go back to your bosses at the SEC with no hard evidence and no story to tell."
"I'll keep that in mind. Thanks."
The Sheriff steps into her car, buckles up, and starts the engine. Before leaving she hands Markham a slip of paper, "That's where Elysium is. Tomorrow night. Be there. Memorize the address and lose the paper."
Without adding anything else, she zooms off into the dark night. The engine growls like a tiger. Markham takes the paper and goes inside his temporary Haven.
He looks around at his home for the next couple of nights. He knows he needs to get a lead on Roxanne, but before that, he pulls out his Motorola flip phone and begins dialing a number.
After the 3rd ring, he hears a familiar voice, "Clifford Wright, SEC Enforcement Division."
"Hi, Clifford. It's me, Markham. I..." he pauses and gathers himself, "I'm calling to check in."
Clifford sounds somewhat groggy, "Oh, wow, Markham. How are doing down there in Flimont City? Anything to report? Any updates or new leads regarding your investigation into Luciano and Paul?"
Markham can't exactly reply, "Yo, Clifford, someone tried to murder me and I'm certain it's connected to the 2 jokers we're investigating."
Instead, he replies with vague and general answers, "It's all good down here, boss."
Clifford heartily laughs, "Oh, hahaha! You better have a nice tan when you get back here. Is there anything you need, have you run into any trouble?"
"Nope, no trouble. Nothing that I can't handle."
"That's what I like to hear from my best man, Markham. Stay focused, don't get distracted, and let us know if you need anything else."
Before hanging up, Markham asks, "Uh...Clifford?"
"Yeah?"
Markham takes some time to inquire, "Um...how's Jamie doing? Has she...gotten into any hot water or...trouble of any kind?"
Clifford scoffs, "Apart from the stunt she pulled off a year ago? She's been pretty quiet since. And you risked quite a lot standing up for her like that, y'know."
Markham corrects his boss, "It wasn't a stunt, sir. It was her First Amendment right as an American citizen- she was exercising her right to free speech and giving her honest opinion."
(She took part in an anti-war protest and spoke her mind on a few matters related to it).
"Hmm, I'm not in the mood to argue with you right now. Jamie...yeah, she's fine. She misses you, though. A lot."
"I'll call her."
"Yeah. Get some rest, Markham. And when you get back, we're gonna have to SERIOUSLY talk about your future here at the SEC. I've sent your records to the Chairman and he's genuinely interested in meeting you. Who knows, there might be a promotion in your future."
"Thanks."
"Yeah. Stay safe out there."
With that, Clifford hangs up. Markham sighs and begins to dial another number. Diego asks if everything is alright. Markham responds with a tight smile and a nod.
As he waits for his friend to pick up, he tells Diego, "I'm just calling a friend."
Diego nods and leaves him to it. The Gangrel goes into the kitchen with Marisol and the 2 share a few sweet nothings, a little nuzzling here and there, and a few kisses.
On the other end of the line, Markham hears a voice message, "You've reached the cellphone number of Jamie Pollux, the one and only, haha! Please leave a message AFTER the beeping beep bop boop and I'll get back to ya!" She sounds cheery and bubbly.
He hears the beeping and he clears his throat, "Hi, Jamie. It's Markham. I, uh...I'm doing well, yeah. How are you doing? Staying out of trouble, I hope? Heh, I...I'll call you again, OK? Yeah. Take care."
He hangs up and looks at his phone's screen. He blinks and thinks of his Touchstone. He hopes that nothing bad happens to her and that she'll be fine.
Markham feels the weight of his Kindred condition bear down upon him and he slowly goes to the basement. Diego is cuddled up with Marisol on the couch. Her shirt is buttoned down and her hair is messy.
Diego's got a wide smile on his face and his arms are around Marisol's shoulders. The 2 are in the midst of discussing something.
The 2 Ferals spot Markham silently going down the stairs. Marisol gets up and dusts herself off.
"Hey!"
Markham turns around, "Hmm?"
Marisol regards the Baali for a moment, studying every detail, before she inquires, "How was your night? You keep my D out of trouble?"
Diego sits up, also interested in this.
Markham's face is impassive and he answers, "It was alright. We went around town, saw the uh...sights, met another Gangrel named Raul, and um..."
Diego chuckles and fills in, "Gave our Gringo friend his first ever experience in a lowrider! You should have seen the look on his face when that beauty went bouncing up and down, hahaha!"
Marisol plainly smiles and contemplatively nods, "Ah, nice, nice. Is that all you 2 did?" She folds her arms and waits for an answer.
Diego shifts in his seat, getting a little uncomfortable, "We also asked around for someone who might--might be able to help Markham here."
Marisol perches an eyebrow and raises her chin, "Oh, who?"
Diego hesitates a little, but he does sheepishly answer, "The Brujah prostitute, Roxanne."
Marisol grimaces, "That puta?! Why her?!"
Markham answers, "It's not like I have any other choice. Look, the people who that hitman used to work for don't seem like the forgive-and-forget types, and the longer I stay, the more I'm putting you both in danger."
Diego's brows furrow, "But we're Clan Gangrel, ese. Anyone fucks with the 5th Street Cholos, they ain't leaving on a full tank, y'know what I mean?" He does sound very confident in the martial abilities of his Clan writ large.
Even Marisol straightens up and agrees, "We can handle whatever is thrown at us, but..." she turns to Diego, "...we still have to be careful. No one wants a repeat of '95."
Diego nods and clicks his tongue, "Exactly. So stop worrying about us, but if you're gonna get violent, don't hurt our house too much- it's all we got, man."
Markham nods a few times, "Sure, I understand. Are--are you sure you're OK with having me around for a few more nights? I could easily find another hotel--"
Diego cuts him off, raising his hand, "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. No, we already decided- you're staying with us and that's that. You're in vato in distress and it's the right thing to do."
Marisol concurs.
Markham then asks, "What about Pedro? He's made it clear he hates Baali."
Diego waves his hand dismissively, "Pedro doesn't live here, me and Marisol do. Besides, you're a guest in our Haven and therefore a guest under the protection of the 5th Street Cholos. We got your back, homes."
Marisol warns, "Provided you don't do anything stupid or anything you'll regret--"
She takes a few steps closer to the Baali, "--like calling those pendejos at Immigration and ratting us out."
"I'm not planning on doing that."
"Good."
Markham goes downstairs, but before he does, he stops and turns to his 2 hosts, "And uh...thank you. For everything."
Diego hollers out, "Eyy, don't mention it! You'd do the same if we was in your shoes and you was in ours, right? Right?"
Markham quickly nods and continues on his way. Marisol goes back to Diego, the 2 of them whispering to each other and making small talk.
Markham settles into his temporary bedroom and takes a look at the slip of paper he received from Sheriff Velma. He commits the address of Elysium to memory, tears the paper up, and throws it away.
He then closes his eyes, but his mind is still buzzing with thoughts and worries. What's happening with these resurfacing memories is strange and unnerving, even for him.
Over the decades, Markham has done his best to suppress those memories to the darkest recesses of his mind. He simply goes about his work at the SEC, stays back to chat at the office for a few minutes, and always makes sure to get back to his Haven before sunrise.
It's been his routine, night after night, for decades. First, it was work as a fraud investigator for a small firm in the town of his birth. Fearing that his true nature as a vampire would be discovered, he applied for a job at the SEC.
They pretty much took him in and the night shift was just fine for his needs (which weren't much). His work has become his entire existence, and he doesn't mind that, for it allows him to go through his existence without incident or trouble.
For decades, he has maintained the Masquerade, and it's been working just fine. But, how long do charades like this often go on for?
Will Flimont City be Markham Reed's undoing? Will the cracks in his façade lead to dark places or is there a chance to do some good in a place that is anything but?
His phone starts ringing. The vibration is enough to rouse him out of his mini reverie.
"Hello?"
It's Jamie, "Hey, stranger, I got your message and my heart skipped a beat, haha! How are you holding up in sunny Flimont? Got a tan yet? Oh, oh, did you meet someone?"
Markham faintly smiles, "Jamie. Hi. I've...been pretty much focused on this investigation."
Jamie laughs, "Now there's the Markham Reed I know! All work and absolutely no play! No, but seriously, loosen up a little, y'know. Meet someone nice and pretty and kind and uh...y'know, hehe."
"Hmm. Yeah. So, how are things on your end? I hope you're uh...staying out of trouble."
Jamie sighs, "Yeah, I'm going along with the flow, haha. And I just wanted to thank you, again, for sticking up your neck for me after um...y'know, the thing."
Markham equably replies, "You're well within your rights as an American citizen to say and think what you want regarding current events, Jamie."
"Thanks. I--I mean it. You risked a lot by speaking up for me like that and I won't ever forget it." The sincerity in Jamie's voice is apparent, genuine, and heartfelt.
Markham plainly responds, "You're welcome."
The anxiety is apparent in Jamie's tone when she says, "The more I read about Flimont City, the less I'm able to sleep at night. Uh...how is it down there? Is it as bad as they paint it??" Her voice trails off into silence.
Markham scratches his cheek, "Hmm. I haven't really taken the time to see the city, but from what I've seen so far...yeah. It's pretty terrible, Jamie."
"Damn!"
"Hmm, yeah, that's 1 way of putting it."
Some awkward silence follows before Markham says, "Well, I should get back to work and let you get back to whatever it is you're doing, which I'm hoping is productive."
Jamie faintly chuckles, "Yeah, yeah. I miss our banter."
"Hmm, me too. Goodnight, Jamie. Stay out of trouble, keep your head low, and um...good luck with everything. I'll call you again, hopefully soon."
"Thanks. Same here- stay safe out there, OK? Byeee!" Jamie hangs up. Markham puts his phone away and closes his eyes again.
He thinks back to that memory that resurfaced earlier tonight. Coach Jenkins took small town, high school football way too seriously. Markham remembers that he'd constantly use military jargon, bark orders, and be a general hard-ass on everyone.
Sure, back in Markham's town, football was a big deal (especially on the local level), but Coach Jenkins took it to another (crazier) level.
There was a time in Markham's mortal life when tossing a pigskin around would've been a promising path for him- but things changed and took a horrible turn as time rolled on.
Right now, Markham deems it fit to not dwell on such painful memories too much. As it is, the circumstances around his Embrace (and eventual Re-Embrace at the fangs of Burt) are painful enough.
So, it's become a haze, an amalgam of jumbled images and emotions. Some things stand out, some don't. Most are lost to the passing years, the tides of time. But such things rarely stay buried (or lost) forever.
Back upstairs, Diego has just finished giving his lady a nice foot massage and he's getting ready for bed. Marisol looks at her boyfriend with great affection and love, smiling fondly at him. She strokes his hair and pulls him in for a kiss. Diego happily reciprocates.
Once he pulls back, he has that anticipatory look in his eyes, "You--you wanna do it?"
Marisol looks over to the door leading to basement and shakes her head, "Not with a guest around, D. I just don't feel comfortable. I'm going to need time to adjust to that Baali down there."
Diego softly sighs, "Yeah, I know. I just...I miss it."
Marisol caresses his face and reassures him, "Hey, I miss it too, but..." She leans closer and huskily whispers, "There's always tomorrow and the tomorrows after that."
Diego lifts an eyebrow, "Oh, yeah? Haha, yeah, I guess tomorrow ain't going nowhere, and we ain't going nowhere, either." He playfully pushes Marisol's shoulder and the 2 laugh a little bit.
Sunrise is around the corner, so they get ready for bed. Diego checks to make sure all the windows are shut and all the curtains are closed. He then joins Marisol in their bedroom and the 2 get cozy under the covers.
They give each other some tender kisses and wish each other a long and easy rest throughout the day.
Mauve shuts her laptop and sighs deeply. Her eyes are heavy with fatigue and she's exhausted from staying up all night working on her manipulating of the numbers to enrich her benefactor. She rubs her forehead and massages her temples.
She looks at the emerging sun from her living room window and wistfully says, "I'll never see palm trees in the day again." She gets up and heads to the bathroom to splash some water on her very pale face.
The water is just right and it soothes her. It also gives her some peace and clarity, if only for a few minutes. After that, the Malkavian snuggles up into her bed, puts on a black eye mask, and prepares to be taken in by the abyss of the day-long slumber that Kindred inevitably succumb to.
It won't be long before the paths of Mauve Lilac and Markham Reed converge, for better or for worse. There are many things that still remain to be said and done.
Chapter 7: Shut Up, Pay Up
The sun, that great fiery star, rises over Flimont City and its mortal citizens go about their lives. The Kindred of Flimont City are all dead to the world, and will be until sundown tonight. Their minds and bodies are in a sort of stasis.
They are as cold as corpses, their Unliving bodies regenerating and repairing themselves during the day, as they dream of the night they've left behind and the night to come. For the Kindred, today is just another sunny day in "Sunshine City", and the days will roll on like this forever.
More or less.
Luciano is awakened by the sound of his alarm clock. He groggily knocks it down in an attempt to stop the irritating beeping. The clock tumbles down onto the hardwood floor with a loud "thud" and stops making noise. He slowly sits up in bed, yawning and stretching.
He blinks a few times, rubs his eyes, and hops out of bed. He's completely naked, his junk dangles a little, and he shuffles to the bathroom. He relieves himself and goes to brush his teeth.
As he brushes, he looks at himself in the mirror and smiles. He spits some toothpaste in the sink, washes his toothbrush, and carelessly tosses it into the holder. He then goes back to his bedroom and confidently walks out onto the balcony.
He surveys the city beneath him and begins his daily morning affirmations, "I'm King Kong and I'm a 100 feet tall. I own this city. I am this city. I'm Luciano-fucking-Donovan and I am the law. I'm the most powerful and richest fucking man in the city."
He aggressively roars a few times. He stretches out his hands to either side of his body and imagines himself crushing everyone who dares to oppose him.
With that, he goes back inside, goes through his closet, and finds something to wear- a pair of chinos, a short-sleeved shirt with a stiff collar and crazy prints on it, and some expensive sandals. He puts on a thin gold chain, some sunglasses, and some expensive cologne.
He admires himself in the mirror and shoots finger guns at himself, grinning like the self-entitled man-child that he truly is. He leaves his bedroom and heads to his kitchen. His phone rings and he goes to see who's calling.
He answers, "Yo, what's up? LDJ speaking."
It's Gordon, "Luciano. Put some clothes on. I'll be there soon." He sounds even more irritable than usual.
Luciano asks, "Why?" He looks down and notices that his fly is undone.
Gordon sighs and stifles a groan, "Because I'm not paid to see your junk, that's why."
"OK, sheesh, calm down. Jesus."
"We need to talk."
LDJ hangs up and attempts to make himself some toast. He frowns and scratches his head, not fully sure of how to work this very pricey toaster that he bought on a whim a few weeks back.
It's shiny and silver, with many buttons, switches, and knobs. It even has a bright display. He tries pushing some buttons and hitting some knobs. The display lights up and starts beeping.
"The fuck is this thing?" he asks, maintaining his clueless grimace.
Like a caveman, he bangs on it with the heel of his palm a few times. He presses the biggest button and the toaster goes off, the metal part shooting up. The bread pops out, slightly burnt. Luciano chuckles.
He then puts the toast on a plate and takes a bite. It burns the tip of his tongue and he spits out the toast, muttering, "Ugh! Fuckin'...ugh!" He drops the toast on the plate and leaves it in the sink.
After failing at toast, he decides to take a few spoonfuls of Skippy peanut butter. With that sticky goodness in his mouth, he goes to wait for Gordon at his couch.
He can barely talk thanks to all the peanut butter he shoved in like a maniac. He's watching cartoons (he's not really paying attention) and waiting for his trusted associate to arrive. He thinks about all the good things that are coming his way.
He doesn't spare much thought about the SEC investigation that's been going on, and it's just as well- he knows, deep down, that a defanged agency like the SEC can't (and likely won't) touch guys like him.
Gordon's knuckles rap against the door. Luciano goes to open it. Gordon stands there and raises his chin slightly. He's wearing a bright orange cravat, a dark suit, silver-framed eyeglasses, and polished slip-on shoes.
LDJ claps his lawyer on the back. The latter winces a bit. The former asks, "So, what's up, Gordo? How you doing, huh?" He leads his retainer to the living room.
Gordon sighs and sits on a nearby recliner chair, "Alright."
Luciano leans forward and clasps his hands together, "So, what'd you wanna talk to me about, huh?"
"I take it you just woke up?"
LDJ proudly nods and grins, revealing splotches of peanut butter staining his teeth, "Hell yeah! You know me, I sleep when I want!" He chuckles heartily.
Gordon frowns, "Have you taken a look at your financials?"
LDJ's jaw almost falls, "Whoa?! Again. M--Mauve came through??"
Gordon plainly says, "You really should be more aware of things, Luciano. Don't end up like Paul- I swear, he doesn't even know his left from his right."
Luciano clicks his tongue and waves his hand, "Hey, Paul's my friend. Anyway, so uh...how much?"
The Pym Reaper sighs and rolls his eyes, "1.5 million dollars."
Luciano springs up from his seat and hollers, "WHAT?!" He pumps his fist and lets out a loud and long whoop. He even starts jumping on the couch and howling.
Gordon remains expressionless and motionless, letting the son of his most-valued client have his...moment, as it were. He waits for LDJ to calm down and for him to stop bouncing up and down like a child going through a mad sugar rush.
Finally, Luciano plops down on the couch, panting and grinning wildly, "Oh, man! Whoa, that Mauve's a fuckin' miracle."
"Hmm. Just keep that one on a leash. I don't know where you find such people, and I don't care, but if she gets out of line, you call me and I'll take care of it."
"Take care of it? How?"
"Don't worry about it."
Luciano shrugs, "Well, OK, whatever. But uh...can we celebrate?"
Gordon looks at his watch and tugs at his cravat, "As much as I'd like that, I have a plane to catch- I'm going to Washington DC."
"OK?"
Gordon side-eyes Luciano, "The nation's capital? Anyway, I'm going there to take care of some business."
Mr. Pym reminds his client, "You're not my only client, kid. I've got others just like you all around this city- young kids with more money than they know what to do with." He gets up and adjusts his eyeglasses.
Luciano waves his hand dismissively, "Yeah, yeah, I get it."
Gordon coldly regards Luciano, "You should really call up your dad and talk to him. I'm sure Luciano Donovan Senior would be proud of his boy. I know I would." For a moment, he turns aside and looks out the window.
He mutters something under his breath before he turns back to LDJ, "Do you even know where he is now?"
Luciano Jr. clicks his tongue and states, "Yeah, he's in the fucking Cayman Islands, slamming every broad he sees and spreading his seed...ugh." LDJ shudders and grimaces at the image of his old daddy getting it on with countless (younger) women.
The image of his dad shagging (if you can call it that) 1 woman after another is enough to make LDJ feel sick. He thinks about how he's the product of his father's rampant promiscuity, and the thought kinda does make him uncomfortable.
After all, his own mother was a struggling middle-class artist who could barely afford to raise a son while Luciano Sr. was able to buy his boy the most expensive of gifts (fancy watches, branded shirts, designer sneakers, etc).
In a way, the young Luciano gravitated towards that- the stuff, the promise of more. And after mom died, LDJ lived with his dad, who is as ruthless as they come. There was a lot of verbal abuse and constant berating and name-calling.
LD Senior wanted to make sure that LDJ Jr. grew up to be worthy of the Donovan family name (and immense wealth that came with it). There's a lotta pressure on LDJ to perform.
Gordon clears his throat, snapping Luciano Jr. back to reality, "Your dad's in Israel, looking to buy some property there."
Luciano's face scrunches up, "There's property there?"
"Yes, there is. Lots of it. It's just a matter of...evicting the squatters and other undesirables." The Pym Reaper's tone is grim and foreboding.
Luciano scoffs, "Ah, well, whatever."
"It'd be nice if you called him and spoke to him about what you've been up to."
"Yeah, yeah, get off my case, OK? I'll--I'll speak to my old man when I feel like, and right now, I don't fuckin' feel like."
Gordon shrugs, "Suit yourself. Do you even wanna know why I'm going to DC?"
Luciano tsks, "Tsk, yeah, to uh...do things."
Gordon paces around the living room, "There's another reason I'm going there..."
The Pym Reaper stops pacing and stands in front of the TV. He faintly chuckles at the cartoon on the screen and says, "It's regarding our SEC 'friend'. You do remember his name, right?"
Luciano grimaces and groans, "What is this, a fucking pop quiz? What's with all these questions, Gordon, huh?! I thought I had you...so you can answer 'em for me! Man, thinking is hard sometimes."
Gordon points out, "You know I won't be around forever, kid. You gotta learn to handle these things when I'm not around--"
"You won't be gone for THAT long and you seem pretty healthy enough, just uh...don't eat drugs and, no wait, don't do drugs and um...eat your greens, right?"
Gordon pointedly responds, "That kind of advice is more suited for that dope fiend you call your best friend. Seriously, do something about his cocaine problem."
Luciano raises his hands defensively, "OK, OK, I will. Don't worry about Paul- he'll be fine. Jeez."
Gordon's eyes narrow and he crosses his arms, "So, what is the name of that SEC guy who's looking into you?"
Luciano squirms in his seat and tugs at his collar, "Uh..."
Gordon exhales sharply, "It's Markham Reed, Luciano. He's 43, or at least that's what his official records say, but something stinks about him and I'm going to DC to investigate?"
"Why DC? Is that where this cazzone (ITA: idiot) is from?"
Gordo answers, "Well not exactly DC. My research indicates that Markham Reed was born in a small town a few miles east of the nation's capital. It's called Greenridge, great property values, if you're interested that is. Nowadays, it's mostly a manufacturing town with factories clogging up the place."
"Uh-huh. And here I though whacking this clown was gonna be easy. Marone. May--Maybe we should've just paid him off or--"
Gordo cuts him off, "No. I don't have all the details yet, but we need to take care of him, Luciano. The sooner the better. Normally, yes, government employees like him would be susceptible to a little...'gift'."
"But?"
Gordon continues pacing about, "But something about this guy just...doesn't click."
Luciano queries, "What about that hitter we paid 60-fucking-grand to, huh?! 60-fucking-grand and no results! I want my fucking money back!" He growls.
Gordon firmly orders, "Calm the hell down, Luciano. The organization the hitter used to run with doesn't do refunds. Deal with it." His tone leaves no room for arguments.
LDJ shrugs, "Sure, whatever. I...got money."
"But it's not all gloomy."
"What do you mean?"
Gordon subtly smirks, "Read today's papers. I wouldn't want to spoil it for you. Let's just say that a thorn in your father's side has finally been...taken care of. For good, this time."
Luciano looks askance at the Pym Reaper, "Sure, thanks, I guess? So, you gonna what, go to this guy's town and um--"
Gordon interjects, "Piece this goddamn puzzle together. In all my life, I've never come across something so--so goddamn frustrating. Like I said last time: the only match I got for Markham Reed just doesn't make any sense." The exasperation in Gordon's voice is apparent.
He continues, "It's like he fell from the sky or some shit. I--I don't know. That's why I'm going there, to get to the bottom of things and hopefully, put this shit to rest. That's why I need you to watch yourself closely while I'm out."
LDJ shrugs, "Hey, I ain't no fucking baby, I can take care of myself just fine."
Gordon points to the side of his mouth, "You got a little Skippy there, Luciano."
Luciano annoyedly wipes his mouth and grunts, "There, happy now?"
Gordon nods, "Anyway, I'll be gone for a few days. Please don't call me unless it's absolutely urgent. I need to focus and do my job without any distractions."
He points a stern finger, "Remember: unless it's ABSOLUTELY URGENT and you have literally no one else to turn to. I'm not here to kiss your booboos, kid."
Luciano scoffs, "Alright, alright, man."
Gordon goes on, "You still have my number in case you need anything, right?"
LDJ nods, "Yeah, yeah, I do."
Gordon Pym curtly nods and makes his way to the front door, he quickly reminds his client about a few (very important) things and leaves LDJ's place.
Luciano watches from the balcony as the Pym Reaper gets in a car and drives off.
"Pfft. I can handle my shit just fine. Ya go on and have a nice time in DC and whatever the fuck that town was called. Greens-whatever. Hmph, sheesh."
LDJ goes back inside and sits down on the couch. He looks around his opulent living room and admires the high-end furniture. He grabs the remote control and begins to flip through some channels.
After a few minutes, he calls Paul and relays the good news regarding the latest 1.5 million dollar windfall. Mr. Cho, of course, is pleased and he agrees to come over in a few hours.
He sounds very groggy and kinda high. Luciano rolls his eyes, not caring to ask where or how or with whom Paul spent his night. After the call, Luciano orders some pizza from Peppy's, since he's already got the munchies and the urge to indulge his every whim.
The pies set him back $100 (he refuses to tip) and succinctly shoos the delivery boy away. LDJ has a few slices and a can of coke before he decides to take a short nap. He leaves the half-eaten pizzas in the kitchen and heads upstairs.
As he's about to sink into his bed, Paul rings the bell. Paul sounds like he's coming down from a very hard trip, so LDJ tells him to take a breather and calm the hell down. A few moments later, Paul enters the house.
"Wow. It always looks so bigger on the inside," he says, craning his neck. His gaze is unfocused and his movements are sluggish. He looks and smells like someone who's been up all night and had a very long bender. His eyes are bloodshot and he's twitchy as hell.
LDJ smacks his buddy's shoulder and beams, "1.5-fucking-million bucks, man!"
Paul softly groans and rubs the place where his best friend smacked him, "I know, I know. I guess that um...golden goose of ours is laying some fat ones, huh?"
"Mm-hmm. C'mon, I got some pies from Peppy's. I asked 'em to put whatever on the pizzas, and boy, it's fucking crazy! I had 3 slices and I'm fucking stuffed. It's the best shit ever!" LDJ giddily leads Paul to the kitchen.
The latter sits at the table and looks at remaining boxes of pizza, all open. He sluggishly helps himself to a pizza topped with chunks of barbequed chicken, tomatoes, capsicums, and olives. Some bits fall off and he hastily shoves them into his mouth.
His stomach rumbles, he belches, and he wipes his lips. He takes another bite, and another, and another, until a box has been cleared.
Luciano stands aside, jaw slack, eyes wide, "Whoa! You weren't joking about the munchies, huh?" He's amazed at his friend's ravenous appetite. Paul looks like he hasn't eaten in a while, but Luciano doesn't press him for deets.
And what else is there to say? The afternoon rolls on and draws to a close when the sun begins its unceremonious retreat beneath the structures of Flimont City. The skies turn dark and the Kindred begin to awaken.
Markham wakes up a bit later than the rest. He's got a stiff neck and a pounding headache. He sits up and rubs his temples. He groans a few times and shifts around on the hard mattress. It's a wonder he even got some sleep on such a stiff thing.
Then again, he's literally a walking corpse, so complaints and issues like this are pretty minor. The stiff mattress doesn't bother him as much as the nightmares he's had over the past few nights. They're the same ones that have plagued him for many years now. Always the same ones.
Only this time, they're a lot more vivid and intense. Markham can practically taste his own past traumas on the tip of his tongue. He can hear, smell, and feel the horror that's been the subject of his nightmares. They're almost always about his hometown, his youth, and whatever happened after.
He doesn't really remember much about those dreams, save for the overwhelming feeling of fear, dread, and despair.
For now, however, the Baali focuses on slaking his ceaseless Hunger, work, and finding Roxanne- in that exact order. He goes upstairs and finds Diego and Marisol snuggling on the couch. They're watching TV and laughing at some soap opera in Spanish.
Marisol greets, "Oh, hey." She turns off the TV. Her hair is all messy and her shirt is unbuttoned, revealing a bit of her chest.
Diego is dressed in a baggy checkered shirt, cargo pants, and socks. He's sitting up and his feet are resting on the coffee table. The TV remote is next to him and feels a bit sticky to touch.
Markham plainly greets the 2 Ferals and asks how they slept during the day. He's hungry, very hungry, and he needs to feed, ASAP. Marisol gets up and dusts herself off. Her hair is tousled and her shirt is still unbuttoned.
She quickly buttons it up and says, "OK, I'm going to work now. I'll grab a meal on the way. Take care of each other, you 2..."
Marisol wags her finger at the Baali, "And don't get my man into trouble, OK?"
Markham nods as way of response.
Diego chortles, "Oh, hahaha! Relax, us vatos are gonna be fine. You go on, now. Err...have fun at work."
Marisol shakes her head and mutters, "It's work, D. It's anything but 'fun'. Hmm." She grabs her helmet, scooter keys, and purse and heads out.
Once the front door closes and she's gone, Markham turns to Diego, "Do you have an extra car or something I can use?" He's hungry and he'd like to get some blood in him before settling down to work.
Diego clicks his tongue, "No. But, don't worry, I'll take you to a different feeding ground this time- how do you feel about skateparks, hmm?"
Markham perches an eyebrow, "Isn't that where kids go?" He's genuinely confused at the Feral's suggestion.
Diego waves his hand, "Pfft. No, not exactly. It's mostly frequented by older folk looking to...unwind or whatever. C'mon, I got work tonight, and by that I mean helping build some houses, doing some fruit picking, and other stuff that Gringos wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole, heh."
"All that in 1 night?"
Diego snickers, but there's barely any mirth or joy in it, "It's what I gotta do to survive, homes. I'm an undocumented Salvadoran man being racially profiled by pigs, called names, and spat on. But, I still help to build these people's houses, pick their fruits, and clean their streets, and what do busters like us get for it? Huh?"
Markham's mouth forms a tight line and he averts his gaze. He's unsure of what to say, if anything.
Diego sighs deeply and grips Markham's shoulder, "I ain't saying all Gringos, homes. We've met some really cool ones- you, for instance, some chica at the diner...I've met a few good ones, and some not-so-nice but not-so-bad ones, and most are kinda in-between, y'know what I'm talking about?"
"Yeah. People are...complicated."
Diego concurs with a subtle smile, "Exactly. Do you ever wonder?"
"Wonder what?" Markham asks.
Diego continues, "If things are gonna get better in this new century- Y2K and all that shit. Cellphones, computers, and the Internet. What next, huh? Flying cars, robots?" He's a bit wistful and thoughtful, almost reflective, but only for a brief moment.
"I--I really don't know."
Diego shrugs, "Yeah, I--I don't, either. I hope it gets better- for all of us, man. But, there's a lotta shit from the past that remains...unresolved."
Markham agrees, "Mm-hmm."
Diego sighs and figures that Markham, being the cold and withdrawn person that he is, is gonna take time to warm up to others. Not that the Gangrel blames him or anything. Diego doesn't know what Markham's been through.
All Diego knows is that he wants to help and be a friend, as best as he can. A vato in distress is a vato in need, and is thus deserving of help. That's (sort of) his motto. He's willing to make sacrifices where needed.
Right now, he's trying his best to be a Good Samaritan, but Markham's not the easiest buster on the block to read. Still, Diego's gonna treat him good, regardless.
Diego goes to grab some tools, "So, yeah, the skatepark is the place to be. A lotta grown-ups. We don't feed on no kids, man."
"Yeah, same here. I can't speak for the Baali here because I don't know any of them, and quite frankly, I don't wanna get involved with any of them...or get too involved in Kindred politics around here. My work is my priority."
The Feral flips a few light switches and ushers Markham outside. As they get to the curb, Diego turns around and says, "I hear ya, homes. So, what do you wanna do after we feed?"
"I need a place to charge my laptop and uh...if you don't mind, some peace and quiet."
Diego thinks for a moment, biting his lip in uncertainty. How would Marisol feel about leaving Markham all alone in their Haven while they're off working? He'd be an utter fool to leave a stranger unsupervised in their home.
Diego scratches the back of his head, "Hmm. I need to check some things out with the queen of the castle, first, haha." He motions for Markham to wait while he goes off to make a phone call.
Marisol's phone rings just as she finishes satiating her inner Beast. She quickly licks the victim's puncture wound shut, checks that their pulse is still strong, and gently places them back down in a nearby alley.
Her phone rings a second time. She looks at the Caller ID and answers, "What's up, D?" Her voice is a little hoarse and low.
Diego nervously shifts around and fidgets with his car keys, "Hey, I--I just need to ask you a few things. You still busy, or..."
"Nah, I just finished 'eating'."
Diego faintly chuckles, "Good, good. Um...our guest wants to do his work. He says he needs a place to charge his laptop, sure, done. He also said he needs some...peace and quiet."
Marisol furrows her brows, "Hmm, I see. I'm not too thrilled about the idea of leaving him alone, but I understand his work is important. He can stay in the basement, as long as he doesn't make a mess."
Diego exhales softly, "OK, OK, that sounds great. I uh...actually fixed up the sockets down there last week, let's hope it doesn't zap this poor Gringo, haha!"
Marisol faintly chuckles along and gets on her bike. She bids farewell to her boyfriend, puts on her helmet, checks her clothes, and zooms off to her place of work, the scooter purring and buzzing along.
Diego returns and gently claps his hands together, "OK, the boss lady approved, but...don't make no messes or else YOU'RE on cleanup duty, OK? I got some sockets in the basement, if that's alright with you?"
Markham equably responds, "I can work with that. Thanks."
"Hey, don't mention it, c'mon, let's go and check out some skateboarders." Diego leads the way, the pair hopping into his pickup truck and heading off to the skating park.
Diego and Markham are cruising down the city's main street. They've left the neighborhood and are now on the main drag. The traffic here is insane and Diego has to drive very slowly, lest he get in a wreck or something.
His pickup truck is a few years old and could do with a check-up (along with an oil change), but he simply doesn't have the time or money to keep it maintained.
Along the way, he shakes his head and gestures to the sea of cars in front of him, "Ah, traffic in this city has always been a fucking pain, man. What would normally be a 10-minute journey now takes 30, if we're lucky, hmph."
He goes on, "And people get real fuckin' mad, too. They honk and honk and yell and curse like mad, and that's when the cops come in and make everything worse. And busters who look like me end up getting stopped over and interrogated about our papers and random shit like that."
With anger in his voice, the Feral adds, "You'd think they'd be happy enough that we're doing all their dirty work, and then some, huh?"
"Yeah. I hear ya. The system's...not exactly up to par."
Diego scoffs, "No shit. Remember those vatos we picked up and dropped off last night, the ones hanging around Walmarts and Home Depots, looking for some work so they provide for their familias?"
Markham answers, "It's not something you easily forget. I remember seeing a few of them back in my city, but I didn't really know much about their...predicament."
"Hmph, yeah. Anyway, this is Flimont City, homes. And THIS ain't even the worst, lemme tell ya that much."
Markham inquires, "How do you help them, exactly?"
Diego replies, "Well, the only way I know how- I drive 'em to and from whatever job sites they've been 'hired' at and sometimes, I can lend them a hand, if they want it."
"Hmm."
Diego explains further, "Sometimes, their 'bosses', if you can call 'em that, are 'nice' enough to let me join in and do some work, too. I remember driving a guy to his court-appointed Immigration hearing a few years back."
Markham looks at Diego, "I assume it all went well."
The Gangrel scoffs, "For now, yeah, but who knows, hmm? Tomorrow, these pendejos might decide they don't want him in the country no more and deport his ass back to 'Mala, then what? You tell me."
Diego angrily pounds the steering wheel and mutters, "Fuck! Goddamn fuckin' bastards. This system's so fucked! I don't know who's more racist- the pendejos running the show or the ones enforcing the law, huh?!"
Markham turns aside and looks at the cars surrounding them. There are a lot of angry-looking people driving the cars, and the ones not driving are also looking pretty pissed off.
People honk their horns and shout and yell, waiting for traffic to trudge along.
The Baali tells the Feral, "Well, it's not all bad. We have due process. What you're suggesting seems...implausible, in my opinion."
Diego isn't too comforted by that assertion, "Mm-hmm. You think it'll be the same, in say, 10, 20 years, hmm?"
"What, it's not like they're gonna start snatching people off the streets. I'd like to believe in the rule of law, Diego. Due process, order, rights, stuff like that. Otherwise, it'd be utter chaos, and not even Kindred would survive. It'd be everyone for themselves, and there wouldn't be much room for us."
"Huh. I guess our immortal asses will be around to see just how bad it gets in 20 years."
(It gets real fucking bad).
The traffic moves along at a snail's pace, hell, snails are faster than the chugging, sluggish cars that move for a few meters and stop, rinse and repeat. The roads are congested, the air is polluted, and there are far too many cars and not enough infrastructure.
There are even a few fender benders here and there. Motorists get off and trade blows and harsh words. Markham grimaces at this unfortunate sight. Diego shakes his head, having borne witness to many such road-rage incidents over the years.
Eventually, the 2 Kindred reach their intended destination. The skatepark is a graffiti-covered concrete jungle, with plenty of ramps, bowls, stairs, and other fun features that appeal to the youth and young at heart.
Many people, Kindred and Kine alike, are already here. Some are chilling and listening to music coming out of boomboxes and other audio equipment. Others are riding, doing tricks, and enjoying themselves.
It's a warm and inviting place. The vibe here is laidback, the people are cool, and the mood is friendly and (generally) non-judgmental.
The lighting isn't all that great and there aren't very many places to drag a person for feeding purposes. Markham figures he'll just have to improvise. Diego figures as much.
But, the Feral knows exactly where he'll be going. He heads to the restroom and enters the farthest stall, leaving Markham to his own devices.
The Baali first has to decide who will be his prey for tonight. He surveys the area until his eyes land on some goth chick smoking some marijuana and showing off her navel piercing.
She's dressed in a black fishnet shirt, tight leather pants, and scuffed combat boots. Her hair is black and her makeup is dark and heavy. She's hanging out with a few of her goth and skater buddies.
She looks to be in her late 20s and has a certain wild and carefree demeanor.
Markham knows better than to approach his prey, so he waits until she splits from the rest of her group and follows her down a path leading to a secluded corner of the skatepark.
He watches her from afar as she sits on the concrete slab, pulls out a fresh joint, and lights it up.
It's almost too easy.
The Demon activates his Obfuscate Discipline. He completely fades away and becomes a shadow-like apparition, invisible to the naked eye. He approaches the goth girl, his footsteps not making a sound, and stands directly behind her.
He waits for the opportune moment, and when it comes, he wraps his cold, pale hands around her throat and yanks her neck back. The goth girl is shocked by this and drops her lit joint.
She struggles against the Baali's grip, but her resistance is futile. Markham leans in and bites into her neck, letting her sweet blood fill his mouth and pacify his roaring Beast.
He makes a few slurping sounds and tightens his grip when she tries to break free. Eventually, the girl loses consciousness and goes limp. Markham continues his feeding until the girl's blood supply is almost drained.
The goth lady is unconscious, but her pulse is still strong.
Thankfully.
Markham gently lets her down and makes sure she's comfortably positioned. He licks the wound on her neck and walks away.
He meets up with Diego and the 2 of them leave the skatepark. They have had their fill and feel refreshed and ready to face the night ahead.
Elsewhere...
Dr. Collins has just finished slaking his thirst in a more...civilized manner. He discards the bag of blood  and tosses it in a nearby bin. He washes his hands and wipes his mouth. His fangs retract and he's left to look like a perfectly normal human being.
The Beast within is satiated and is no longer roaring at the surface.
The Tzimisce doctor then sits on an armchair and reads through today's newspaper. He folds 1 leg over the other and leans back. His eyes widen in surprise when he sees the 2nd page.
The headline reads: "Former Flimont Times Journalist Found Dead At Sunnyvale Home."
Dr. Collins lightly gasps and shakes his head. The drop head reads: "Nicky Schroeder, Aged 36, Was Found Dead At His Sunnyvale Residence, Authorities Claim Home Invasion Gone Wrong."
Surprisingly (or not), the police are very quick to sweep it all under a rug, shrug their collective shoulders, and move on.
Yeah, the same Nicky Schroeder that Markham spoke to a few nights back.
For his part, the good doctor mutters to himself, "Damn. Just damn." He peruses through the other articles, but nothing else really catches his attention.
He puts the newspaper aside, grabs his phone, and calls up his Ghoul, but it seems like Brock's phone is off; he's probably still in his classes. If anything, he's determined to become a plastic surgeon and make it.
The Tzimisce smiles at this, and not long after, he's got a visitor. It's none other than the Sheriff herself. She knocks on his door and the doctor allows her in.
The Ventrue Sheriff is wearing some smoky eyeshadow, a light trench coat, driving gloves, and heels. She's got a folder of some kind in her hand.
"I have news," she dryly says.
Dr. Collins motions for her to sit. She takes a seat opposite him and crosses her legs in a very elegant manner.
He then inquires, "Well, what is it?"
Sheriff Velma answers, "Meeting's been pushed back an hour. Also, I take it that you have the cash ready to pay Prince Antonio?"
Dr. Collins's face almost contorts into a scowl at the mention of the entrance fee into the Primogen Council, but he's quick to put on a professional smile, "Yes, yes. I do. $10,000- all cash." His voice is cool and collected, but there's some pain behind it.
The Sheriff nods, "Good. Count it and make sure there's no counterfeit notes."
Dr. Collins sighs, "Hmm, OK. Are there any more surprises you have for me?"
Sheriff Velma studies the Stoker from head to toe, eyes narrowed, "You know that I'll have to perform a full background check on you, right? To be honest, I wasn't expecting Prince Antonio to pick you as...interim Primogen. Speaking of, any news on Galeb?" she asks, voice low and eyes narrowed.
Dr. Collins's brows go up a little, "No. Nothing." His face twitches and he quickly shifts in his seat.
The Sheriff cracks a quick smirk and raises her chin. She adjusts her hair and asks, "Something the matter, doctor?"
Dr. Collins evasively replies, "No--no. I was just uh..." He seemingly knows more about Galeb's disappearance than he's letting on, but Sheriff Velma is wise not to push him too hard.
Yet.
"Hmm, if you say so, then. Now, about your background check, you free to go over a few things now?"
Dr. Collins looks at his watch and shakes his head, "Actually, no. I have to go the clinic now. Patients to see, appointments to keep, and so on." He gestures to the door and adds, "Sorry, I'm sure you understand."
Sheriff Velma gets up and dusts herself off. She says, "Hmph, fine."
Before she steps out of the Flesh-Shaper's Haven, she turns around and offers, "Why don't I stop by your clinic later on, hmm? You could give me a check up and we could finish up with that background check."
Dr. Collins professionally answers, "If something ails you, then, sure, I can try to fit you in a few hours. I'll have to check."
The Sheriff reminds the Primogen, "You're not gonna shake me off so easily, Dr. Collins." She twirls her fingers and saunters off to her vehicle.
Once she's gone, the Tzimisce shuts his front door and breathes a sigh of relief. He goes to check on his private stash of bagged blood, and sees that it's starting to run dry. He's been drinking more often and consuming larger amounts than usual, lately.
"Hmmm, I guess I'll need to order a new one. Hmph." The good doctor proceeds to grab all his stuff (including the bag of cash) and leave his Haven. His first stop is the clinic, and from there, the meeting at Elysium.
At the clinic, there aren't too many patients, save for a few regulars and a teenager who's come down with a mild case of pneumonia.
Dr. Collins is very plain and very professional in his duties and function as a doctor. He's been doing this kind of thing for decades longer than he cares to remember. Still, it's something he's very good at.
Even his medical knowledge is bang-up-to-date and he never judges or looks down on any of his patients. Sure, his bedside manner could use some tweaking, but his dead heart is in the right place and he truly cares about helping the mortals who walk into his clinic, regardless of who they are or how much they have or whatever.
Wes, the receptionist at the clinic, continues fielding calls and filling out patient cards for the influx of new arrivals- a family of 5 has just come in and is being attended to by Dr. Collins, who's currently running a quick check-up and giving them their diagnosis and prescription.
Aside from the new patients, there's an older lady who's having a bad reaction to her medication and a young guy who's come to consult the doctor about his 5-year-old sister's recent foot surgery.
The Tzimisce doctor handles the cases and gives his patients his best advice. He tells a single mother of 3 kids that their eldest daughter has a mild case of asthma and the medicine she's currently taking is working well.
He advises the younger man to wait a little while longer and to give his sister's foot another week or 2 to heal up.
After a few hours, a fidgety-looking woman walks in and sits. Her small child trails behind her and has a runny nose, baggy eyes, and a hoarse voice. The mother nervously twirls her hair and looks around.
She's dressed in a very garrish and bulky outfit and her makeup is mismatched.
Wesley asks, "How may I help you? Do you have an appointment, uh...?"
The woman's voice is barely audible, "Um...I have a...cold." She clears her throat and continues, "My daughter has a cough, a cold, a bit of a runny nose."
Wesley grimaces at the amount of snot just leaking from that poor kid's nose. He offers the mom a box of tissues and presses his lips into a thin smile, "The doc will be with you shortly. May I please have your name?"
"Wachowski, uh...Katherine Wachowski. My daughter is...Susie." The woman's voice is quiet and unsure. She looks at her daughter and rubs her shoulder. Susie's eyes are red and teary. She sniffles and coughs.
"OK," Wes gets up and knocks on the doctor's door, "Uh...doc?"
Dr. Collins puts away his private photo album of memories, tucks it away in his secret compartment, and goes to answer the door. Wes explains everything and ushers the duo in on the doctor's orders.
The young mother is visibly nervous, but the doc presents a calm and nonthreatening image to put her at ease. He has seen all sorts over the years.
After a while, he diagnoses Susie with a cold and gives her and her mother some medication to take.
Katherine objects, "Do you um...do alternative treatments here, doc?"
Oh, great. It's one of THOSE types.
Dr. Collins stops himself from rolling his eyes, "No. I'm a real doctor, not some kind of quack. If you're into that, you're in the wrong place."
Katherine presses, her daughter continuously wheezing and coughing in the background, "Do you have something, say, a natural remedy? Something not derived from a lab or whatever. Something that won't make my kid autistic."
Oh, shit.
Dr. Collins furrows his brows when he hears that last utterance, "What's that supposed to mean? Nothing can 'make' you autistic."
Katherine wildly gesticulates, "Uh...vaccines can. I read this about this guy, Wakefield something something. He did a study on vaccines and--"
Dr. Collins stops her right there with a sternly raised finger, "Andrew Wakefield is a discredited liar, a disgrace to his profession, and a fraud."
He then realizes something, "Is--is your daughter even vaccinated?"
Katherine grimaces and makes a face, "What?! NO! Of course she isn't! I don't want her being all autistic and stuff."
She continues, "You can't tell me what to do with my daughter, doctor. This is a free country and we can do whatever we want here in America. So, uh...you got any natural remedies or something to help her out?"
Dr. Collins claps back, "So you'd rather have a perpetually sick child than an autistic one, is that what you're saying?"
Katherine gasps and puts her hand on her chest, almost insulted by such an insinuation. Her voice grows louder, "Excuse me?!"
The Tzimisce doctor doesn't back down, "What, are you willing to let your daughter die instead of vaccinating her? Do you know, do you have any idea what the world was like before vaccines came along? How old are you, anyway?"
"41."
Dr. Collins lifts his chin, "So, you were born in the 60s, then. That means you can remember the horrors of polio and measles, right? The crippling effects of these diseases."
"Um..." Katherine's eyes dart about.
The doc goes on, "It hasn't even been 50 years since smallpox has been eradicated from most of the world. Do you wanna know how they did it? Crystals? Crushed-up herbs? Letting it run rampant?" His tone is firm, forceful, and unyielding.
"..."
Dr. Collins walks up closer to her and spells it out in no uncertain terms, "A coordinated vaccination program that costed a measly 300 million dollars. Despite the tensions of the Cold War, the Soviets helped--"
"I didn't come here for a history lesson, doc."
Dr. Collins scoffs, "That's the problem with people like you- you don't learn from history despite living through it. All you do is doom future generations, like your kid over there, to go through horrors that were thankfully put to rest by international cooperation, collaboration, and the hard work of the medical and scientific community."
He adds, "Y'know, the people who actually know what they're doing and talking about."
He goes on, "But you won't be able to appreciate it because, like an idiot, you refuse to vaccinate your kid, and that means she's gonna have a very hard life ahead of her."
The Tzimisce grimly concludes, "If she even lives that long."
The child is old enough to understand that last part. Her eyes widen a little and a look of fear washes over her face.
"Wh--wh--what?" Her voice is barely a whisper.
Her mother tries to shush her and tells her everything is fine, but it had to be said. Dr. Collins never believed in sugarcoating things. If you had cancer, he'd tell you- no beating around the bush with this guy!
"Your kid is gonna suffer and die because of YOUR ignorance, not mine. You've doomed her, and I hope that you live with that for the rest of your life."
Katherine hugs her daughter closely and stammers, "Is...is there something I can do now, doc?"
"Apart from vaccinating your child, taking your medicines, and not being a pain in everyone else's butts, no, not really."
Katherine foolishly asks, "What about OxyContin? My ex-husband's cousin's brother's mother said it helped with her joint pain."
Dr. Collins sighs in frustration and massages his forehead with his fingers, "Oh my god. OxyContin is poison, alright? It's highly addictive and you have no business giving it to a child."
Katherine is still a little skeptical, "Uh...but Oxy is this wonder--"
Dr. Collins cuts her off firmly, "A wonder drug that'll turn you into an addict. I don't care about your anecdotes. Take a trip to southwest Virginia and see the wonders of Purdue's 'miracle' drug for yourself. If you have the stomach for it. No, no Oxy. Take the medicine I told you to take and get the kid vaccinated."
Katherine's expression softens a bit. Without saying much, she grabs her kid and bolts out the door, slamming it behind her.
The doctor's office is eerily silent for a few minutes, save for the ticking clock and Wes's tapping pen. The latter looks at his boss as he steps out and says, "Gee, doc, you sure told her. I--I overheard a bit of it. People still believe that Wakefield guy, huh?"
Dr. Collins growls, "If I ever see Andrew Wakefield, I'll skin the bastard alive and flay him."
Wesley is a little taken aback by that remark, "Woah, doc, easy there. It's OK. I uh--"
"He's done a lot of damage, Wes. He's got blood on his hands, kid, and the bastard's only getting warmed up."
Wes slowly nods, "Mm-hmm. Yeah. Vaccines absolutely don't cause autism, right?"
Dr. Collins sighs, "No. And even if they did, a healthy autistic person is much better than a child under 6 feet of dirt." He doesn't mince words or hide behind a thin veneer of tact, here.
"I mean, I hear ya, but I'm not a doctor, yet. I won't comment too much on the issue. But, when I do eventually become a doctor, I'll make sure to always ask about my patients' vaccination status."
The Tzimisce puts his cold hand on Wesley's shoulder and squeezes it, "You're a good kid, Wes. I'm sure you'll make a fantastic doctor someday."
Wes smiles from ear to ear, "Thanks, doc. It's good to have someone like you to look up to. Um, so, we don't seem to have any more patients coming in--"
Before Wesley can conclude, Sammie the Thin Blood comes bursting through the front door. She's holding her son in her arms and almost on the verge of tears. Wyatt trails behind her, his eyes darting about and his head turning.
Sammie runs up to Dr. Collins and begs him to help her kid, who's having trouble breathing. The Tzimisce quickly motions for her and her son to come in and sit down.
The young mother explains her Ralf's condition, "He--he said he was feeling all woozy, doc. Oh--Oh, doc, ple--please, help me!" Every syllable is punctuated with desperation and worry.
"OK, OK, I need you to calm down, first." Dr. Collins looks at the boy's pulse and gently pats him on the back. The kid's eyes are glassy and his nose is runny, partially bloody. He's very pale and his lips are quivering.
The Dhampir child wheezes and mumbles something softly. Dr. Collins quickly grabs his stethoscope and listens to the boy's heart and lungs. The former is a little slow, and the latter are making some faint gurgling sounds.
Sammie looks on with horror. Her brother sits by her and holds her close.
After a few tense moments, Dr. Collins puts his tools away and says, "Well, your son is showing signs of acute bronchitis."
The Thin Blood audibly gasps, eyes widened in horror.
Dr. Collins allays her fears, "It's OK. It's not serious, Sammie."
Wyatt rubs her back, "Shhh, shhh."
Sammie is a bundle of emotions right now. She looks at her son with great fear and apprehension, and she's a bit overwhelmed by what the doctor just said.
Dr. Collins continues, "Acute bronchitis is a mild respiratory illness that usually clears up on its own within a week or so. He just needs rest, plenty of fluids, and possibly some over-the-counter medications- not necessarily antibiotics."
Sammie nods and mutters, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Uh, wait, fluids, like--like, b--blood?"
Dr. Collins asks, "Have you been giving him any of the blood I sent you?"
Sammie frowns and shakes her head vigorously, "No, n--no. I--I mean, I got it and all, but I'm just so...uncomfortable with giving my kid blood, doc."
Dr. Collins checks to make sure the door is shut. He doesn't want a mortal like Wesley overhearing this. He turns back to Sammie and asks, "What is it, exactly, that makes you uncomfortable?"
The young mother's face goes somewhat red, but she figures that she needs to be honest with the good doctor, "Um...it's just kinda gross, doc."
Dr. Collins softly sighs, "Look, Sammie. Ralf IS half-Kindred. He needs the blood, Sammie. I really wish there were another way, but your child NEEDS it. Think about it, you're a Kindred, his dad wasn't--"
Sammie scoffs, "Augh, don't remind me."
Dr. Collins continues, "The blood will strengthen his immune system and keep him going. As he grows, he's gonna notice a lot of changes in his body. He needs someone to guide him through it."
Sammie takes a deep breath, "I know. I just..." She sighs, her head drooping low, "I'm just scared, is all. Scared of the blood, scared of him hating me when he grows up while I remain the same, I'm scared of any other Kindred coming after us and taking him away from me, o--or worse."
Wyatt gently shushes her, "Shh, shh, relax. Nobody knows and no one's coming to take your son away, Sammie."
Dr. Collins adds, his voice lowered, "Yes, what he said. As for the other Kindred, I won't let anything happen to you or your son."
Sammie skeptically presses, "How are you gonna even ensure that, hmm? That Sheriff, Velma or whatever her name is, is a fucking psycho. She killed a whole house full of Thin-Bloods a few years back. She'll kill me, my kid, and anyone she thinks is a threat to whatever it is she thinks she's protecting."
Dr. Collins doesn't necessarily disagree with Sammie, "Hmm. You might be right about that. She is a bit of a piece of work. Look, let me handle that, OK? Right now, you just focus on getting your boy better. Do you still have the blood with you?"
Sammie shifts in her seat and shoots a quick glance to her brother. The doctor perches an eyebrow. Wyatt admits, "We might've uh...helped ourselves to...err...all of it."
Dr. Collins exhales and shakes his head. He refrains from chiding them. Instead, he simply asks, "All of it?"
Wyatt answers, "Yes, all of it." He sounds very shaky.
The Tzimisce groans and gets up. He's gotta order a new batch, and soon. He turns to Sammie, "Alright, then, no worries. My personal stash was running out, anyways."
Dr. Collins reaches into a cooler and pulls out a couple of bags of chilled blood. The good doctor nods approvingly and motions for her to follow him. She picks up her son swallows hard.
Dr. Collins removes the cap from a blood bag and hands them to Sammie, who, in turn, gently pours its contents down the throat of her son.
"Open up, here comes the choo-choo train!" She half-heartedly says.
Ralf's mouth is wide open and his baby fangs are protruding- they look gnarly. He's able to drink a decent amount of blood, which is a good sign.
Wyatt looks away, grimacing. The smell of blood is quite pungent and potent.
The boy's face instantly brightens up and he hungrily slurps up the precious sanguine sweetness like it's juice from a juice box. His mother watches on with both awe and horror, but mostly the latter.
Ralf smiles and lets out a small burp when he's finished. Sammie's eyes are widened in shock and fear. She's seen a lot of scary stuff over the years, but nothing quite like this.
Dr. Collins observes the boy and is satisfied with his condition. He turns to Sammie and her brother, "Well, it looks like he's already improving."
Ralf flashes a toothy smile at the doc and playfully growls, fangs still out. Dr. Collins presses his lips into a very thin smile.
The Thin-Blood rocks her son back and forth and queries, "Will he uh...will he become addicted to this stuff?"
Ralf giggles and kicks his legs. His face is all rosy and he seems a little better now.
"Not as far as I'm aware. In fact, the more blood he consumes, the better his recovery. However, I will caution you against giving him too much at once."
Sammie nods and asks, "So, um, can you please teach me how to, uh, do the thing, y'know--"
Dr. Collins gives her a sidelong glance, "What thing? You just take off the cap and feed him the blood from the bag. And, please, not yours or Wyatt's. It needs to come from a mortal, understood?"
Sammie gulps deeply and nods, "Maybe--maybe, I'll mix some in with his regular food?"
Dr. Collins shrugs a shoulder, "You could try that. Just be careful. I wouldn't recommend using either to supplement or replace the other. With Dhampirs like him, balance is key."
Sammie and Wyatt thank him for his hospitality and kindness. Sammie carries her child and leaves. Wyatt holds the door open for her and gives little Ralf a little tap on the nose with his finger.
Ralf laughs and kicks his legs some more.
Before leaving, Wyatt asks, "You uh...want us to fill out some kind of form for your records or--?"
Dr. Collins shakes his head, "I think we better keep this between us. For all our sakes." His tone reflects a hint of uncertainty.
Wyatt smiles and shakes the Stoker's colder hand, "Well, thanks for everything, Dr. Collins."
Dr. Collins asks, "How's the thing going with his dad? Have you managed to convince him to pay child support."
The Duskborn lawyer winces and sucks some air through his teeth, "Gordon Pym is the kinda guy who knows every loophole that exists. If 1 doesn't exist, he'll make it outta thin air. He's...not exactly easy to talk to and negotiate with."
"So, he IS aware of his son's existence?"
"More like in denial- he denies ever meeting my sister and knocking her up. Pfft."
Dr. Collins lowers his head, "I'm sorry to hear that, Wyatt. Don't worry, if there's anything, come by the clinic at anytime, alright?"
Wyatt shakily smiles and meets his sister in the reception area. Wesley offers Ralf a juicy, red lollipop. Ralf asks for 1 more, which Wes gladly gives the kid, "Here ya go, kid."
"Enjoy," Wes ruffles the Dhampir's hair around.
Ralf grins and beams with excitement. He shows his mom the 2 lollipops he's received and says, "Mommy, mommy! Look, lowipops!"
Sammie smiles, but there's so much pain written all over her pale face- being a hard-working single mom and a Mercurian is no trivial feat for any person.
The Thin-Bloods leave the clinic and head home. Dr. Collins has had enough excitement for tonight and decides to head to Elysium.
"Hey, doc, you uh...gonna be alright?" Wes calls out.
The good doctor nods and heads for the door, "Yes."
"Doc?"
"What is it?"
"How come you didn't ask those people to fill out any proper forms or make an appointment. I know you can be pretty...strict about that."
Dr. Collins twitches for a moment, "Just...I have my reasons, kid. They're uh...having a pretty rough time right now."
Wesley's expression softens. Being from a poor and disadvantaged family himself, he knows what that's like, "Oh, OK. Y--Yeah, yeah, I totally get it, doc. Totally. You're--you're a good guy, doc, always looking out for people."
Dr. Collins plainly responds, "Well, someone's gotta do it, kid. This city is harsh and unforgiving to people like that. If I have a chance to ameliorate even a fraction of it, then I'm taking it."
The receptionist cracks a smile and arranges a few things on his desk. He then remembers something, "Oh, before you leave, that um...Oxy sales guy came here again, looking for you."
Dr. Collins groans, "What did he want now?"
Wes narrows an eye and grimaces, "He offered me a trip to Cancun, some more crappy scroll pens, and a...new computer."
"My god, these people. What did you say?"
Wes sighs, "I mean, a new computer does sound nice, doc. We've had this since 1999."
Dr. Collins puts on his coat, "I'll look into it, Wes. Not right now, but I'll look into it. Anything else?"
Wesley cracks a wider smile, "Aww, thanks, doc. Nope, nothing else for tonight, unless you're expecting someone else to come bursting in, heh."
Brock pushes the clinic's front door open and greets Wesley, "Hey, Wes. Hey, doc, what's up?" The Ghoul looks tired and there are dark circles under his eyes. He smells of coffee, but his clothes are quite impeccable.
He's dressed in a shirt with colorful geometric patterns, beige trousers, and brown moccasins. His mullet is neatly combed and his sunglasses are shiny. He's got a folder of papers in his hand. He also has a black satchel bag slung over his shoulder.
Wes snickers, "What was it, 70s night at the bar?" He points to Brock's shirt. The Ghoul playfully punches him on the shoulder. The receptionist pretends to fall back in pain. Dr. Collins rolls his eyes and chuckles.
The Domitor asks his Ghoul, "Brock, going somewhere?"
Brock shifts around and looks a little evasive. He hesitates before simply answering, "Yeah, a date."
Dr. Collins smiles and nods, "Good, good."
Wes queries, "Who's the lucky guy?"
Dr. Collins narrows his eyes, "You...knew about Brock??"
Wes plainly shrugs and stumbles upon the rest of his words, "Yeah, I did. Why? Oh shit, Brock, dude, I didn't know that you didn't tell--"
Brock holds up his hand, "It's alright, Wes. I told the doc here a few nights back and he...took it well, which honestly, kinda surprised me, heh."
Wesley smiles and goes back to work. Dr. Collins nods approvingly and tells Brock, "We have something to take care of tonight."
The Tzimisce Ghoul gets the hint and nods, "Ah, yeah, yeah. C'mon, then." He ushers his Domitor outside and they both prepare to get into the latter's car.
Brock remarks, "Oh, the goofy Honda, huh?"
Dr. Collins eyes his Ghoul, "What's wrong with it?"
Brock winces and partially grimaces, "Eh, it looks...like something outta a b-movie. Ever thought of swapping it for something less...goofy?" He chuckles and adds, "No offense, doc."
Dr. Collins shoots him a quick glare and answers, "None taken. I've had this car since 1995. And with the recent...expenses, a new car isn't really something I can think about now."
Brock winces even more, "Ugh, yeah, that. That's nothing but extortion, doc--"
"I'd like to think it's much more than that, darling." A woman's smooth voice cuts through the air. It's none other than Sheriff Velma. She's leaning against her own vehicle and has her arms crossed.
Brock is startled and almost yelps, "Holy shit!" He clutches his chest and breathes heavily. The Sheriff looks amused.
Dr. Collins is unfazed. He simply asks, "Can we help you, Sheriff?"
Sheriff Velma approaches the 2 men and leans in closer to the Tzimisce, "I'm here for my check up, Doctor Collins."
The doctor tells her, "You're late."
The Ventrue Sheriff lazily waves her hand, "You know how traffic is in this city. No one from Flimont is known for their...punctuality, which is such a shame because I remember a time when cars didn't rule the roads." She smirks and takes off her gloves.
Brock raises an eyebrow, "Uh, what?" He looks at Dr. Collins, who simply shrugs.
Sheriff Velma ignores Brock and continues, "Anyways, I'm here now, so let's get on, shall we? And let's not forget that little background check I have to perform on you. Same goes to you, Ghoul."
Brock frowns, "What background check? What the hell is she talking about, doc?" He gets a little nervous and starts fidgeting with his hands.
Dr. Collins reassures him, "It's just a routine background check, Brock. Nothing to worry about."
The Sheriff adds, "Oh, I wouldn't say that, Dr. Collins. I'll be thorough, but I'll need at least 1 person who can vouch for you. Any candidates, mmm?"
Dr. Collins answers, "Dr. Sarah. She's a dentist and of the same Clan- she can vouch for me."
The Sheriff's eyes turn to Brock, the intensity of her gaze makes him squirm. She asks, "And you, darling? Anybody who can vouch for you?" Her voice is smooth and velvety, but there's a certain sharpness to it.
Brock hastily answers, "Yeah, Dr. Collins. He's been my Domitor for the last 7 years, that HAS to count for something, right?"
Sheriff Velma stifles a sigh and her expression dullens, "It'll do. You're a Ghoul, anyway, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find out more about you." She then turns to Dr. Collins and says, "Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to get on with my check up."
The Stoker ushers her inside his clinic and into his office, "Right this way."
On the way in, she stops and gives the young receptionist a once-over. He nervously looks up and smiles at her, waving awkwardly, "Hi. You here to see the doc?"
Sheriff Velma softly chuckles, shakes her head, and follows Dr. Collins inside. Brock stands outside and waits for his Domitor to finish up. He checks his phone and sees that he has a message from his date.
This was a time before the advent of smartphones and selfies, so it's just a simple text message that reads: "Still on for tonight, handsome?"
Brock texts back: "Of course. I might be delayed a bit, is that OK?"
The reply comes quickly: "Sure is, just as long you don't keep me waiting forever. I can only stay hard for so long, y'know?"
Brock smirks and replies: "Haha, I'll be there soon, promise." He puts his phone away and waits for Dr. Collins to finish up.
In the doctor's office, the Blue Blood Sheriff takes a seat across from the doctor and elegantly folds 1 leg over the other. She crosses her arms and raises her chin, "So, where do we begin?"
Dr. Collins clears his throat and says, "Well, is there anything troubling you?"
"No."
"Nothing? Nothing at all? A pain in a part of the body that doesn't seem to heal on its own, a strange and almost tight feeling in or around your chest, an ache in your lower back?" he presses.
Sheriff Velma shakes her head, "No, no, and no. I'm perfectly fine, thank you very much."
"What about blood? Is it safe to say that you get your um...nightly intake?"
"Mm-hmm."
Dr. Collins queries, "How fast do your wounds mend themselves?"
"I haven't gotten into a major scuffle in decades, darling. But, my wounds do mend themselves fairly quickly."
"What was your last scuffle, anyways?"
Sheriff Velma smirks, but the menace is apparent, "A few Thin-Bloods thought they were welcome in this Domain. Needless to say, I do not suffer the Weaklings to live."
Yikes.
Dr. Collins is taken aback by her cold and icy tone. He doesn't show it, though, "Hmm, I see. And what's with your whole Cheshire cat routine? Do you often surprise people and butt in on conversations?"
The Ventrue Sheriff's face tics and her lips curl up, but only for a moment. She quickly regains her composure and replies, "It's a useful tactic to keep the riffraff on their toes, Dr. Collins. And besides, I enjoy seeing people squirm."
Dr. Collins raises his eyebrows at that statement, "Hmm, I see. And do you feel in touch with your Humanity or is your Beast being given more leeway than you care to admit?"
Sheriff Velma lifts her chin, eyes narrowed in defiance, "My Beast is well under control, Dr. Collins. It's the Beast of everyone else in the Domain that concerns me."
Dr. Collins straightens up, "Is that why you're so keen on doing background checks on everyone?"
"It's 1 of my reasons, yes. Besides, your position as Primogen for the Tzimisce Clan is only temporary...until Galeb is found. Prince Antonio is confident that he'll turn up soon."
Dr. Collins doesn't bother offering any response to that. He continues with inquiring about her overall psycho-physiological state, "Do you have any Childer?"
"No."
"None at all?"
"No."
"Any plans on having any?"
"Maybe."
Dr. Collins then asks, "What Generation are you, anyway?"
The Sheriff shrugs, "I don't know because counting Generations is the most confusing things for us Kindred to do. I get the gist of it, but it gets so horribly confusing when...Diablerie is thrown into the mix, hmm?"
Dr. Collins presses on, "Have you ever Diablerized anyone, Sheriff Velma?" His tone is direct and pointed. His eyes are cold and emotionless.
The Sheriff takes a long and hard look at Dr. Collins, "No, I have not because that is something that the Camarilla frowns on."
"Not always."
"Hmph, your opinions and 'witty' observations regarding the Ivory Tower are best kept to yourself, do I make myself clear, Flesh-Shaper?"
"Crystal."
Sheriff Velma shrugs off her trench coat and sits up straighter, her chest subtly emphasized. Dr. Collins glances briefly, his expression unreadable.
"My eyes are up here, doc."
Dr. Collins's eyes lurch over to the Sheriff's arms and he spends some time fixated on them. His mouth moves, but no words seem to come out.
Sheriff Velma smirks and puts her hands on her lap and leans closer, "It's impolite to stare, doc."
Dr. Collins snaps out of his trance and shakes his head quickly, "Sorry, sorry. It was...never mind."
Sheriff Velma clicks her tongue, "Ah, ah, ah. It didn't look like nothing to me. I know the Tzimisce Clan Compulsion all too well, darling. Is there something you see that you like? And please, don't even think about lying to me."
Dr. Collins's eyes dart back to her arms. He looks uncomfortable, "No. Th--There is nothing that I find to be appealing, Sheriff."
The Sheriff scoffs, "Hmph, is that right?" She stands up and places both her palms on the doctor's desk.
Dr. Collins gets an even better look at her arms. So long, so elegant, not many blemishes in sight. Her muscles are lean and firm, "Hmm, yes. Yes, yes it is right."
The Ventrue Sheriff softly smirks, "Mmm, it certainly is, isn't it? Now tell me what 'it' is?"
The Stoker reaches out and strokes her arms, gently and with great care. His mouth is agape and his eyes are glued to her limbs, "It's so...beautiful, so perfect. And...they look so st--strong."
"Mmm-hmm." She leans even closer and whispers, "Yes, I'm sure they are."
Dr. Collins stands up and yanks the Sheriff's arm closer to him. He obsessively and almost feverishly caresses and inspects it with his hands. His eyes are wide and unblinking. His hands move in quick, frenetic motions, but he remains quiet and focused on his work.
Sheriff Velma wrestles her arm away from the doctor and glowers at him, "My, my, my. Aren't you full of surprises, huh? So what is with you and people's arms? Or is there something that you saw? A lump, a growth, perhaps?" She quickly puts her coat back on.
He slinks back and puts a hand on his head, somewhat embarrassed. He admits, "You're right. It's a part of my Clan's Compulsion, our...Covetousness. I--I have a thing for arms."
Sheriff Velma is amused by this admission, "What kind of a 'thing'? A sex thing?" Her voice is smooth, low, and somewhat seductive.
"No."
"Do you have a fetish?"
"No, not at all like that."
"Then what is it?"
Dr. Collins gulps, sighs deeply, and takes a few moments to respond, "I--I have this overbearing obsession, this--this desire to add 2 more arms to my body. I remember, distinctly, drawing a picture of a 4-armed person when I was a kid and having it be so...normal for me ever since then."
"Oh? Is that so? And that's how you became so obsessed with arms?"
"It's the only logical answer I can come up with, yes. The idea of having extra appendages intrigues me and has haunted my mind for many years."
"Mm-hmm."
Dr. Collins confesses, his face in his hands and his eyes downcast, "I've thought of it all the time when I was young- in high school, college, even medical school. I'd wonder to myself if it was feasible, like, taking someone else's arms and attaching them to the sides of my body--"
Sheriff Velma points out, "Well, you're Tzimisce, and extensive, dare I say, obscene body modifications are a core part of your Clan's culture. Is this such a surprise to you, doctor?" Her tone is even more low.
"..."
The Ventrue Sheriff's eyes are intense, "You do realize what you're doing, right? Not fulfilling your deepest, darkest desires by letting this unusual Compulsion persist could have disastrous consequences."
She reminds the good doctor, "And I don't need any more problems right now. So, are you gonna let that happen? Because you can't put that cat back in the bag, darling. Once something like that is out, it doesn't go back in. Ever."
Dr. Collins grunts, groans, and changes the subject, "Enough, enough. Just...stop. Also, the Tzimisce Clan isn't just about what you mentioned. We're a lot more than that."
"Yes, you certainly are. From what I've been told by other Stokers, yours is the only Clan whose Antediluvian was an--"
Dr. Collins interjects, "An alien, yes. The Eldest, The Ancient, or the many other names for...it. It is not from this world, which explains certain things about our Clan- more positive aspects like our politeness, pleasantness, hospitality, curiosity, and such."
Sheriff Velma claps back, "And despite all these alleged good qualities, your Clan is 1 of the founding Clans of the Sabbat- the same roving maniacs that threaten to tear everything down and drown us all in fire."
Dr. Collins clarifies and emphasizes, "Look, a lot of the Tzimisce in this city are all Old Clan Tzimisce- we predate the formation of the Sabbat and have remained faithful to the Camarilla. I'm Old Clan Tzimisce, too."
"So you say. I just wonder how an alien's blood courses through your veins. I'm sure the history behind that is...fascinating, hmm?"
Dr. Collins nods, "The official account is that the spaceship of our Antediluvian crash-landed in the City of Enoch millennia ago. Anyways, the ship was damaged beyond repair."
Sheriff Velma is intrigued by this, "Oh? Do go on, it's not every night you hear something so...riveting."
Dr. Collins obliges, "So, it couldn't go back to it's home planet or world or wherever it's truly from. The Tzimisce Antediluvian was essentially stranded on our planet. An extraterrestrial being stuck on Earth- a foreign being, a foreign entity, in a foreign land forced to adapt and survive."
"What happened next?"
"This is where things get murky. Most agree that it was either Enoch or Irad who Embraced this strange extraterrestrial being. They tried turning it into a Ghoul at first, but that didn't seem to work."
"So they Embraced it instead?"
"Mm-hmm, yes. A handful of accounts and theories go even further and suggest that our Antediluvian was the first ever Kindred, returning to planet Earth to beget the rest of us and check up on the rest or some such."
Sheriff Velma shakes her head from side to side, "My, my, my. That theory does throw a spanner in the works, hmm? Where does that leave Caine, his Childer, the other Antediluvians, et cetera, et cetera?"
Dr. Collins shrugs and sighs, "I study this in my free time. I could spend hours, hell, weeks explaining everything to you."
"Are you implying something?"
"No, no. Of course not. I wouldn't dare do such a thing." There's a small hint of sarcasm there, but it's very well-hidden.
The Ventrue Sheriff doesn't seem to notice it and asks, "And what does all this have to do with your desire for additional arms?"
The Stoker shrugs, "It is what it is, it's the uh...nature of my Blood. I can't help it, I can only resolve it. Why did you ask me about my Clan's history, anyway? I'm sure you have access to people who are more knowledgeable and informed than me."
The Sheriff chuckles, "Well, Dr. Collins, you're in a unique position as the Tzimisce Primogen for this Domain."
"What do you mean?"
"You didn't earn it, it fell on your lap thanks to Galeb's...disappearance."
Dr. Collins sharply sighs, "I still don't know where he is, alright? But if I find anything, you and Prince Antonio will be my first call."
Sheriff Velma nods, "Good. And how long have you been in this Domain?"
Dr. Collins thinks for a moment, "Since the late 1990s."
"And before that?"
"I had something, a short-lived in Magnolia City, but I decided to reestablishing myself as a General Practitioner here in Flimont City."
"Why? Magnolia City is wonderful, isn't it?"
Dr. Collins sort of agrees, "Yeah, compared to a hellhole like Flimont, Magnolia City does sound wonderful. Maybe I should've stayed back and..." he trails off and looks into the distance, his eyes lost in thought.
Sheriff Velma snaps him out of it, "You said you reestablished yourself as a General Practitioner."
Dr. Collins straightens up, "Yes."
"Any issues there? Any troubles with your paperwork? Any problems with your records, both professional and personal?"
"None whatsoever."
Sheriff Velma's eyes narrow and she looks skeptical, "No troubles at all? That's very interesting, very interesting, indeed."
The Stoker raises an eyebrow, "What are you getting at, Sheriff Velma?"
Sheriff Velma doesn't answer. Instead, she sniffs, "And how about this clinic of yours, hmm? The walls look old and cracked, some of the posters seem outdated, the tiles creak every now and then. I notice these things, Dr. Collins."
The Tzimisce doctor clicks his tongue in frustration, "I'm not exactly rolling in money, Sheriff Velma..."
The Sheriff asks, "Is it because of the whole quote-unquote 'extortion' that we're 'forcing' you to pay?"
Dr. Collins claps back, "$10,000 is not exactly chump change. I had to ask a close friend of mine and even get Brock to hit his savings just to come up with the amount. I also had to make some adjustments to my budget."
"How did you even manage to do that, then, hmm?"
"That's not really your concern. Just be glad you're getting your fucking money. What do you even use it for? And why so much?" The doctor takes on a more aggressive tone.
Sheriff Velma remains composed and as cool as the corpse that she is, "Now, now. No need to get all...curt with me, doc. I thought you Tzimisce were the more politic types; after all, that's what you said- 'politeness, pleasantness, hospitality, curiosity', et cetera. So, how's that working out for you?" She smiles, but her eyes are icy cold.
Dr. Collins glowers at her for a moment, then sighs and shrugs, "I'm sorry. It's just...absurd. Did--did Galeb keep up with his payments, because I sure as hell am not interested in any more surprise charges being thrown my way."
Sheriff Velma is amused by that statement, "Oh, darling, please, don't be absurd. Either way, the Prince gets paid. I'm here to make sure he gets it on time is all. Don't shoot the messenger, as they say."
Dr. Collins's face scrunches, "So, wait, what, you don't get a cut of that cash?"
Sheriff Velma snickers, "Pfft, of course not. Even I have a monthly fee I have to keep up- $2500."
The Tzimisce Primogen sharply exhales, "Goddamn. What kind of a racket is Prince Antonio running here?"
The Ventrue Sheriff holds up her finger and waggles it, "Don't even think of going there. Anyway, what is your relationship with Galeb? Were you 2 close?"
Dr. Collins plainly answers, "We were...acquainted, yes, but not necessarily friends. He was our Clan's Primogen for as long as I can remember. Why?"
Sheriff Velma presses on, "What did you last speak about before Galeb's disappearance? Was it about gray aliens? Maybe motherships and the little green men inside, hmm?" There's a hint of amusement that laces her words.
Dr. Collins sighs deeply and shakes his head, "No, we didn't talk about that. We mostly discussed Kindred matters, y'know, keeping up with the times, so to speak."
The Sheriff nods and asks, "How often did you 2 talk?"
"We'd usually meet up every now and then to discuss Clan-related issues and the like. He came in here for a check up. It was nothing, really."
Sheriff Velma thoughtfully nods, "I see. And what might've ailed an Elder like him, hmm?"
Dr. Collins purses his lips and weighs his words carefully, "That's doctor-patient confidentiality. I'm not breaking it. Ever."
Sheriff Velma faintly chuckles, "Very well. You do realize that I WILL be cross-referencing and triple-checking everything you're telling me here tonight, yes?"
Dr. Collins equably tells her, "Knock yourself out. I've got nothing to hide."
Sheriff Velma shakes her head slowly, "I'll be the judge of that."
Dr. Collins takes a risk by asking, "And, hypothetically speaking, if I was hiding something...what then, hmm?"
Sheriff Velma intensely eyes him, her gaze piercing into his very being, "Do you really wanna go down that path, doctor? Why, is there something you're hiding, something that you know, that you should be telling me? Because I will find out. I always do."
The good doctor presses his lips together and raises his hands in mock-surrender, "No, no, nothing at all. I'm an open book and I get along really well with the other Tzimisce here. There's no need to...aggravate the situation any further. Galeb's disappearance has got us all on edge."
The Ventrue Sheriff concurs, "Very much so. Prince Antonio is determined to find Galeb, as am I. You believe Galeb was, what, Beckoned off?"
"It's the most logical inference to make. He was an Elder and Elders all over the world are succumbing to its call."
"And what are the other possibilities?"
"Not exactly pleasant ones, I'd imagine."
The Sheriff steeples her fingers together and keeps her eyes locked on the doctor, "How unpleasant, hmm?"
Dr. Collins shifts under the weight of her dark gaze, "It depends. It could be anything from him getting Diablerized to an old sin from his past finally catching up with him."
The Sheriff lifts her chin, "'An old sin,' hmm? Are you...religious, doc?"
The Flesh-Shaper replies, "I'm a Presbyterian, but I am also a man of science and reason. For me, religion has and will always be a personal matter, separate from other spheres of life and Unlife- be it politics, medicine, science, and education."
Sheriff Velma lightly smiles, "Interesting. You're an interesting man, Collins."
Dr. Collins tells her, firmly but gently, "I'd prefer Dr. Collins. It's only fair to show someone the respect they're due- it isn't much to ask, honestly."
Sheriff Velma keeps calm, "Indeed. But, who knows, hmm? There might be big asks in the future. As a Primogen for the Tzimisce Clan, are you prepared to answer them? Galeb certainly was, and he wasn't squeamish about any of it."
Dr. Collins sternly responds, "I'm not Galeb. But, I will still represent the best interests of my Clan going forward...or for however long this position as Primogen lasts."
"Don't get too comfy, darling. I'll find him, sooner or later, I'll find him." If anything, the Sheriff is far too overconfident in her abilities and it's showing.
Dr. Collins easily picks up on this, "Don't get too Arrogant, Ms. DuPont. I know the Ventrue Clan Compulsion all too well. I know what that kind of stiff-necked Arrogance can lead to."
The Blue Blood grits her teeth a little, "It's Sheriff Velma to you, Stoker. And please don't patronize me; I know what I am."
(Looks like he kinda struck a nerve there, eh?) 
Dr. Collins shrugs a shoulder, "Is there anything else, Sheriff Velma?"
The question lingers in the air for a while as the Sheriff regards the good doctor, her steely gaze still focused on him. She finally tells him, "Tell me about your Ghoul, Brock."
Dr. Collins leans forward, "What do you wanna know about him?"
Sheriff Velma sniffs and takes a look around, "Any skeletons in his closet that I should be aware of?"
Dr. Collins firmly answers, "No."
The Ventrue Sheriff faintly chuckles, "Now I know there's something you're not telling me. C'mon, tell me. We can work through it together." Her tone is very low.
The Stoker doesn't buckle or fold, he stands firm and stares the Sheriff right in her eyes, "It's, quite frankly, none of your business."
Sheriff Velma claps back, "If it happens within the borders of Flimont City, then it IS my business."
Dr. Collins sighs in frustration, "Can--can you keep a secret? I don't want too many people finding out."
The Sheriff lazily waves her hand and motions for the Tzimisce doctor to go on.
Dr. Collins says it plainly, "Brock's gay. He came out to me a few nights back and it's a recent discovery, really. I--I wasn't ready to find out, but I was more than happy to help and support him." His voice is steady and firm.
Sheriff Velma shrugs a shoulder and comments, "That's hardly a secret, darling." Her tone is cool and detached, her expression is blank and devoid of any emotion.
She blandly goes on, "It existed in my time, too. Albeit, suppressed and...not openly talked about as it is now. Oh, well. But, are you sure he hasn't had any other secrets he'd rather not tell you about, hmm?"
"I trust Brock with my Unlife. He's done well by me for the past 7 years and I see no reason to mistrust or doubt him." There's an undercurrent of strength in the good doctor's words, one that makes it hard to challenge them.
Sheriff Velma sniffs and mulls over her next question, "What about Dr. Sarah?" She gives Dr. Collins a long hard look, her eyes slightly narrowed.
"I've known her ever since I came to this city. Even though our fields are different- she's a dentist- we get along very well and consider each other good friends. We help each other out whenever the other's in need."
Sheriff Velma perches an eyebrow, "And, she'd be able to vouch for whatever it is you're saying, hmm?"
"Of course. And I'll be able to vouch for whatever she's saying." His tone is still very firm.
Sheriff Velma mulls over it and nods approvingly, "Hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I'm very happy you've been so...helpful, so far, Dr. Collins. Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and have a nice conversation, don't you agree?"
"It has its perks."
The Sheriff proceeds to remind him, "Now that you're a Primogen, however long that lasts, you're obligated to take part in a Blood Hunt."
The doctor straightens up and cocks his head, "Who's it been called for?"
"Mm-hmm," the Ventrue Sheriff hums, "Every single Thin Blood in this Domain. If you see any or know where any are, then--"
She gets up and takes a scalpel in her hand. She twirls it around in a menacing, yet elegant, sort of way, "--you're obligated to do your part and kill them."
This doesn't bode too well, considering 2 Thin-Bloods (and a little Dhampir) were here and Dr. Collins didn't turn them in, "I see." His expression is unreadable. It's completely blank, just like Sheriff Velma's face.
He says, "Thank you, Sheriff Velma. I'll--I'll keep my eyes open." It comes off as a bit cold. It's probably on purpose. The Sheriff notices but doesn't comment on it.
She puts the scalpel away and looks down at the doctor, "I won't rest until every last 1 of them have been killed. No exiles, no negotiations, no trials. No. Fucking. Mercy." The last few words come out in a harsh whisper, the sound of something akin to a low growl is heard.
After that, the doctor asks her a few questions of a medical nature, and she answers as best as she can.
The Sheriff, in turn, prods further into the doctor's background, and he does his best to answer her queries in a satisfactory manner (or whatever she deems "satisfactory" enough).
Once all has been said, she walks away and turns around to tell Dr. Collins, "Thank you for your cooperation, doctor. I'll see you at Elysium. Better get moving- traffic in this city is...awful."
"Ta-ta." She twirls her fingers and saunters away. A faint smirk appears on her pale face, and her head is held high. Her movements are brisk, efficient, and deliberate. She ignores the 2 guys in the reception area and doesn't bother to look back at all.
Dr. Collins follows and watches as the Sheriff gets into her car and speeds away.
Brock, who'd been outside waiting, finally sighs in relief.
Wes asks, "Uh...she uh...didn't fill out anything, doc."
The Ghoul snickers while Wes remains puzzled.
Doctor Collins shakes his head, "It's alright, kid. She's...an old friend of mine."
"I see. You have some really interesting friends, huh, doc?"
"Mm-hmm. Keep up the good work, kid. I'm heading out now. Me and Brock have some...things to take care of."
Brock springs up and waits outside, near his Domitor's car.
The young receptionist salutes the doctor and smiles. The Tzimisce Primogen nods and gets into his car. Brock slides into the passenger seat and puts on his seatbelt, "Yep! Buckled-in to the sci-fi mobile, heh."
Dr. Collins starts his car up, the engine purrs and comes to life with a loud growl. The car begins to roll out onto the busy streets and the duo is off to Elysium.
The Stoker tells his Ghoul, "Well, that went well."
The Ghoul looks at him in disbelief, "What??"
"I was half-expecting her to ask me tougher questions, but, it was all pretty milquetoast all things considered."
"Huh. Did--did she ask about me? I'm really too big on someone prodding into my personal life...not that I got anything to hide...well expect the y'know..."
Dr. Collins keeps his hands on the steering wheel, foot on the accelerator, and eyes on the road, "It's alright, I told her--"
Brock gasps quickly cuts in, "YOU DID WHAT?!"
Dr. Collins almost loses grip of the steering wheel, but quickly recovers and calmly tells Brock, "I told her."
"What the FUCK, doc?! Why did you do that?!"
"Well, you told me, didn't you?"
"Yeah, I did! But...it's not like you're...required to do anything about it or...y'know..."
Dr. Collins calmly interjects, "It's alright, it's alright. She's not going to do anything about it. She can't. There's nothing wrong with being gay."
Brock sighs and looks at the city moving by in a blur, "It's--it's just that I'm not exactly ready to come out to everyone else, y'know. Especially to a...Sheriff. I mean, what if she's against it or some shit?"
The doctor gives him a look that's meant to be reassuring and firm, "Then, that's her problem, not yours."
Brock takes a deep breath and slowly lets it out, "I hope so, doc. I hope so."
The duo keep their silence as Dr. Collins maneuvers through the heavy traffic of the city. Cars to the left of them, cars to the right of them. Cars in the front and cars in the back.
It chugs along at the pace of an injured snail. Go forward a few feet, stop, wait, honk like a maniac, and go forward another few feet.
The Tzimisce doctor asks Brock, "You ready to see Elysium?"
Brock shrugs, indifferent, "I guess so. Where's it, anyway?"
"From what Galeb told me, it's an old music hall that Prince Antonio bought at some kind of state auction."
"Wow."
"Hmm. I've been there once, a few years back. It's clearly seen better days...and nights."
"Huh, interesting." The Ghoul places his chin on his palm and stares outside, looking at all the buildings, the lights, and all the people going on their own personal, yet mundane, lives.
He sees a wall covered in graffiti, much of it is fairly banal. He also sees a small group of teens congregating, but not much else.
The Ghoul then decides to break the silence, "So...what do you think happened to Galeb, doc? Like, do you think he was..." he trails off and lets that sentence linger for a bit.
Dr. Collins sighs and purses his lips together before answering, "I--I honestly don't know, Brock. I just wish everyone would stop asking me about him."
Brock chuckles, "I hear ya, doc. He was kind of an asshole, to be honest. I always felt...icky around him." He shudders and grimaces when he recalls the few interactions he's had with the Elder Tzimisce.
Dr. Collins sighs, shakes his head, and doesn't say anything else.
After a long while, they finally make it to Elysium, which is in a part of the city that's more dilapidated and rundown than usual. Dumpsters are overflowing with uncollected garbage. The roads are cracked and there appears to be a fog that hangs over everything.
Brock lets out a low whistle as he sees the old music hall. It looks like a relic of the past, the kind that once used to draw people in from miles and miles away.
Now, it is nothing but a tragic husk of its former self.
There are people hanging out here and there, but not many. Dr. Collins parks in front of Elysium and the duo get out. They take a moment to appreciate the exterior.
The old, rusted sign above the doorway, the boarded-up windows, the weeds and ivy that's starting to take over the front of the place, the chipped and flecked paint, and the way everything feels like a time long, long gone.
They head inside, through the entrance, and up a narrow flight of stairs. Brock asks, "Why does a guy with this much cash invest in such a place and do absolutely nothing about it?"
Dr. Collins replies, "I really don't know, Brock."
The Ghoul smirks and shrugs, "Heh, fair enough."
Prince Antonio is all the way at the far end of the room, talking to someone else. The Prince occupies a large armchair with intricate carvings and adornments. He looks like he owns the place and no one has the guts to tell him otherwise.
His demeanor is that of a man used to getting what he wants when he wants it. He looks over and waves to the Kindred and the Ghoul, beckoning them over to his seat.
Dr. Collins strides over with confidence while Brock trails behind.
The Ventrue Prince gets up from his "throne" and jumps down from the stage with cat-like agility, "Ah! Dr. Collins! Brock!" he extends his hand, his eyes glittering.
He tells them, "Welcome to Elysium- a safe space for all of us. So, please, enjoy yourselves here."
Brock looks around and remarks, "Jeez, what a place, man. You uh...ever thought of doing some TLC?"
The Prince scoffs, "The fuck for? It's fine as is. I might flip this place in the future, y'know, break it all down and get some developers over to build something better in its stead."
The Ghoul keeps his hands in his pockets, "That...sucks. I--I mean, with the right renovations, you could have this place looking good again. I've always wanted to go to a nice, sorta laid-back concert." He sounds wistful and hopeful.
Prince Antonio looks at him incredulously, "A concert? For what? Fat broads howling?" He starts laughing uproariously while Brock scowls.
The Ghoul is not smiling. His expression is very deadpan and cold.
Dr. Collins greets the other guy seated in 1 of the many seats in this dilapidated hall. The cobwebs, dust, and grime cover everything and anything in sight. The stench is bad, a smell of rot and decay mixed with stale, moldy, and dirty air.
Brock takes a whiff and covers his nose, "Augh. Fuck! Disgusting."
Dr. Collins and the Pedro shake hands. The Gangrel Primogen is dressed in a collared t-shirt, baggy pants, and sandals. He's got his knock-off sunglasses perched on top of his forehead.
"Yo, what's good, hermano? Glad you could make it!"
"Oh, yes. Thank you, Pedro." Dr. Collins searches for a seat that isn't covered in dust, broken, or looks like it might collapse if anyone sat down on it.
He mutters to himself, "Goddamn."
Pedro replies, "Yo, dude. Relax, just take in the sights, just...take in the sights." He doesn't sound convinced when saying that.
Prince Antonio takes Brock to a minibar that has been set up in what was once the backstage area. He does a wide, sweeping gesture to the many drinks on offer.
"We got ourselves some Chianti over here, some white wine over there, y'know, a little lagniappe, a little...something extra for all you Ghouls."
With his arm still around Brock's shoulder, Prince Antonio leans closer, "Well, go on, kid. Pick your poison." He hands the Ghoul a bottle.
Brock's face turns sour as he regards the Prince with a cold expression, "And what if I don't drink?" His voice is very dry.
The Ventrue Prince lets out an irritated grunt, "Well, what can I say? I try to be nice, I try to be kind to people, and they--they fucking laugh at me. But, you ain't like that, right, kid?"
Brock gulps deeply and stammers, "I--I barely know you, man."
The Ventrue Prince tisks, "Tsk. Hey, bartender! Get my good friend here whatever he fuckin' wants, capeesh?"
The dull-eyed bartender nods her head. She looks so dazed and out of it. Prince Antonio sighs, "Oh, yeah. This bitch has been acting all weird- she just sits there, moping and doing absolutely fucking nothing, just like the rest of these bums. Until I put her in her place."
Brock nods slowly. He sits on a bar stool and puts his head in his hands, "Oh, my god...what the fuck kind of crazy have I gotten myself into?"
The bartender lady is in her early-20s. She has shaggy hair and baggy blue eyes. She looks very malnourished and there seem to be bite marks and scratches all over her. Brock's eyes widen as he sees it all.
He mutters, "Fuck, fuck, fuck..." as he sinks lower in his stool. He stares at his feet, eyes downcast.
He thinks about running, running fast, running far, and never, ever coming back here. Then again, he is (more or less) bound to Dr. Collins and should thank his lucky stars that the good doctor is not a monster.
Prince Antonio snaps him out of his stupor and asks him, "What? Something the matter? You look like you saw a ghost." His tone is mocking, derisive, and very nasty.
The Ventrue Prince lifts Brock's chin up, "Don't go lookin' at the ground like there's diamonds there. Go on, take a risk, enjoy a lil booze, it's all on the house."
Brock wishes Dr. Collins were here to talk him out of this mess.
Meanwhile, Dr. Collins and Pedro sit together and talk about stuff.
The good doctor tells him, "And you should see her arms. They're like...goddamn."
"Haha! Yeah, she looks pretty fine, amigo. If she wasn't totally loco, I'd probably go for it, y'know. That's me." The Gangrel Primogen cracks himself up with that last line.
Dr. Collins says, "Well, she does have her charm...that's that, I guess."
Pedro remarks, "Mm-hmm. She's a combination of grace and beauty with cunning and relentlessness thrown in. She's like the type of chica to patiently wait for the perfect moment to lunge out and strike without mercy, like a cat."
Dr. Collins agrees with this, "That...is an apt comparison, Pedro."
Pedro tells him, "Haha. Oh, shit. You uh...got the cash for the, you know?"
Dr. Collins hates being reminded about that, "Hmph. Right here. How do you even manage? It's--"
He looks around to make sure no one's nearby before saying, "--Criminal. Absolutely fucking criminal." His expression is severe, but also kind of disgusted.
Pedro is as nonplussed as ever and doesn't take offense, "Well, yeah. What's your point, ese?" He chuckles at the good doctor's obvious discomfort.
Dr. Collins gets a good look at the Feral before speaking, "Seriousuly, how do you manage to keep up these payments?"
Pedro shrugs and coolly says, "I got my ways, homes. I'm not gonna pretend it's easy for me to cough up 5 grand a month, but we Cholos gotta do what they gotta do to survive, you feel me?"
"Mm-hmm. I just hope the Prince has a change of heart."
"Fat chance, ese. He'd sooner walk out into the sun than admit to any sorta wrongdoing on his part."
"He doesn't have any guilt or shame, huh?"
"Nah, bro, that dude's all business, 100%."
The Stoker inquires, "What about Sheriff Velma? Do you 2 get along?"
"We get along alright. She respects Gangrel territory and, in turn, we don't feed on none of their...special vessels, you know, the uh..." Pedro vaguely motions with his hand.
Dr. Collins's nods plainly, "Their Rarefied Tastes."
"Yeah, bro."
"That's...good to know."
"Yeah. So, how's the clinic doing, doc?"
"All well."
Back at the minibar area, Brock is still under a lot of pressure to drink. He gulps again.
The Prince has him in a sort of half-hug and pats his shoulder, "C'mon, kid, don't be shy, it ain't gonna hurt, I promise."
"I'm...not really much of a drinker, man." His tone is flat and he tries his damnedest to squirm out of the Prince's hold.
"What the fuck kinda Ghoul ain't a drinker, huh? I don't know of any that have a drinking problem. I mean, it ain't gonna hurt or nothin', kid, what're you so afraid of?" His tone is smooth, almost sweet.
Brock isn't sure how to get out of this mess, "I--I just don't wanna do it. I got...a--a date tonight."
The Prince snickers, "Well, ain't you a stud. What's her name?"
Oof.
Brock gulps and winces. He feels a tightness in his chest, a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. He shivers a little and hopes this feeling will just go away.
He makes up a name, "Uh...Alice." At the moment, he's not too comfortable about telling the Prince that he's gay.
The Prince keeps pestering, "So, what's she like, huh? She got a good rack, this Alice? A nice ass?"
Brock hesitates, "Uh..."
"Come on, kid. Tell me a little bit about her." He keeps pushing.
Brock takes a deep breath and blurts out, "She's tall, has long black hair, and uh...she's into classic movies and owns 2 pets."
The Prince narrows his eyes, suspicious, "Hmm, is that so?"
Brock shakily nods and looks at the bartender who's just standing there, completely still. She looks at the ground with almost lifeless eyes.
The Ventrue Prince notices Brock looking at her, "Yeah, she ain't sayin' shit, kid. Don't even bother."
The Ghoul nods again and tries to look away, but it's no use.
The Prince remarks, "She does look kinda hot, though, huh? Whaddya think, me and you going at her, huh? You take the mouth and I take the ass, huh?"
A hitched breath escapes Brock as he feels something bile-like rising up in his throat.
Prince Antonio continues, "What? Too much for ya? Pfft, come on, man, we could go right now and fuck her in 1 of the changing rooms, if you want. The others ain't gonna be here for another few minutes."
Brock finally blurts out, "I'M GAY!" His expression is frantic and there's sweat trickling down his brow. He shoves the Prince off him and storms off to where the good doctor is seated. He slams himself next to Dr. Collins. The impact jars the creaky seat, it groans under his weight, but holds.
Dr. Collins looks concerned and asks, "Brock? What's the matter?"
Brock is red with anger, "The Prince wanted to fuck the bartender lady. I--I told him I wasn't interested, but son of a bitch won't take 'no' for an answer."
Pedro's eyebrows shoot up and he mutters something in Spanish.
Dr. Collins sees the Ventrue Prince approaching. The Stoker motions for his Ghoul to take deep breaths and calm himself down, "It's alright, Brock." His tone is soft and calm. It seems to work, Brock slowly starts to calm himself down and is able to breathe more regularly.
Prince Antonio spreads out his hands and screams out, "So, you're a faggot, huh?"
Brock groans and shuts his eyes, he looks down in embarrassment as Dr. Collins glares at the Ventrue Prince with barely concealed hostility.
Pedro mutters something indeterminable while Dr. Collins gets up and walks to Prince Antonio's personal space. They stare at each other, their expressions unreadable. A tense silence hangs in the air.
Prince Antonio lifts his chin, defiant. He tugs on the sleeves of his gray suit jacket and adjusts the collar of his black shirt. His black leather belt and dark shoes glisten under the dim lights of the hall.
He tilts his head to one side and asks, "What, are you a faggot too? You like taking it from the back, too?"
Dr. Collins remains steadfast, "No. There's nothing wrong with being gay, Antonio." His tone is cold, it's almost biting. His jaw is set in a grim, determined line. He takes a few deep breaths and exhales slowly.
The Ventrue Prince bursts out into laughter, "Hahahaha! Oh, you fucking people. I'm Prince Antonio Black. Nobody fucks with me. Sit back down, Collins. As for your Ghoul, keep him the hell away from me." There's a dangerous undertone to his voice. It's a warning that's hard to miss.
Brock hollers out, "Done! And fuck you--"
Dr. Collins holds up his finger and warns his retainer, "Brock, watch it..."
With unmistakable reluctance, Dr. Collins sighs and says, "Prince Antonio is our Prince and he is...owed respect, so...as much as I hate to admit it, Brock...apologize." He makes eye-contact with the Ventrue Prince, there's a hint of resentment, but there's also an unspoken understanding between them.
Brock grunts and half-heartedly says, "I'm sooo sorry for being the way I am."
Dr. Collins shoots his Ghoul a pained look, "Brock..."
Pedro scoots over and rubs the distressed Ghoul on his back, "Hey, hey, easy. Vatos loving vatos is as old as time itself. Ain't nothing to be ashamed of. But, there's a hierarchy in Kindred Society and um...y'know."
Brock nods and gulps again, he tries to fight the tears welling up in his eyes, but it's hard to keep them back, "Yeah, yeah. I--I get it. But...can't the Prince at least keep the creepiness down to a fucking minimum, hmm?"
Prince Antonio clicks his tongue and tuts, "Hey, fairy boy! I'm still waiting for my fuckin' apology...from YOU."
Brock stands up, shakes his head and forces the words out, "I'm sorry for...acting like an asshole."
Prince Antonio wears a smug expression and smirks, "That's more like it. I was being nice to you. I offered you free drinks, free pussy, free fucking everything."
Dr. Collins steps in, "I think he's got the point, Prince Antonio. It...won't happen again."
Brock mumbles, "Yeah, it fucking won't." He pushes past his Domitor and walks out of the building. On the way out, he grazes past Sheriff Velma and Markham who have just walked in.
Sheriff Velma's expression is as deadpan as always while Markham's expression is something like "Oh, boy. What the hell did I walk into?" He's very good at masking it, however, and goes along with Sheriff Velma.
The Baali was able to do some work. Diego's Haven doesn't exactly have high-speed internet, so it was just some crappy dial-up that Markham would have to use for most of the evening. It's all he can do for the moment, but he's still pretty satisfied with it.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Prince Antonio welcomes the Baali with open arms. Pedro stands up and angrily asks, "What the hell is this cabrón doing here?!"
Prince Antonio quickly silences the Gangrel Primogen, "Shut the hell up! I don't need you throwing a fuss, too. Hey, Markham, how the hell how doing, huh?"
Markham plainly responds, "I'm fine."
He looks at Pedro and offers, "If he feels uncomfortable with having me around, then I can leave. I don't even know why--"
Prince Antonio butts in, "Shut up. You came because I wanted you here. I'm the Prince and my word is final. Why is it so fuckin' hard for people to respect that, huh? Gah!" His expression is furious and he grits his teeth, his jaw tightens up, he snarls a bit.
Sheriff Velma greets the 2 Primogen, "Pedro. Dr. Collins. Good to see you 2 are early. We're just waiting on a few more, then we can begin. Prince Antonio, is Pierre coming?" Her tone is even and measured, it's like she's trying her best to placate the Ventrue Prince's anger by changing the subject.
The Prince lazily waves his hand and ushers Markham to a front-row seat that's caked in dust. Markham grimaces and takes a seat that feels harder but is a lot less dusty than the others. He doesn't comment on any of it.
Prince Antonio clambers back onto the stage and plops down on his "throne." He wiggles his ass around until he's comfortable and lets out a deep breath, "Yeah. Pierre'll be here." His voice is deep and slow, it's a lot more calm than it was just a moment ago.
Dr. Collins goes and sits down next to Pedro again.
Sheriff Velma cracks a subtle smirk and explains, "Pierre is Baali, Markham. We thought it would be best to...bring him in. I've already explained your current predicament and he is quite eager to meet you, if I do say so myself. Hm."
Markham repeats himself, "I'm not here to get involved in any of this political stuff. I'm here to do my job and get the hell out as soon as I can."
The Gangrel Primogen snickers and opines, "Smartest fucking thing this Demon Worshipper pendejo has said. Leave him be. I don't know why you wanna help him when it's clear that he doesn't want it. Pfft."
Prince Antonio sighs and turns his attention to Markham, "You see the shit I have to deal with? So, you find anything on who tried to whack ya, huh?"
"I'm close."
The Prince looks frustrated with the Baali's vague and withdrawn behavior. He angrily clenches his hand, "You better be. C'mon, talk to me. What'd you find so far, huh?"
Markham dryly explains what he's learned so far. He also tells Prince Antonio about his intent to find Roxanne and get to the bottom of this.
Sheriff Velma mumbles to herself, "Ah. I see." She is very pensive about all of this, "You know, if it was anyone else, they'd just...never mind. Yeah, Roxanne has got her fingers on the pulse, so to speak. Good luck finding her, though."
Pedro wolf-whistles, "Oh, that Brujah puta, huh? Haha. Find her, do your thing, then get your Unholy ass out of this city. We don't fuck with that devil worship shit."
Dr. Collins holds his tongue and mulls some things over in his head, but doesn't comment on it.
Markham continues to sit in his seat. He doesn't make eye-contact with any of the Kindred around him, but his eyes occasionally dart here and there.
Prince Antonio asks, "So, where you from, Markham?"
"Greenridge."
The Prince nods, "Ah, a town that's a few miles east of DC, right?"
"Mm-hmm."
The Prince shoots a questioning look at this Sheriff. She, in turn, blandly shrugs and shakes her head.
After a minute or so, Clarice, the Malkavian Primogen, strides in. She carries herself with a sense of pride and confidence. She's dressed in a long green dress, a light shawl, and simple flats.
She takes the time to greet everyone, "Hmph, this place. My friends. Good evening." Her voice is very soothing, calm, and smooth. There's an almost unusual quality to her voice that puts people at ease (or does the opposite, in some cases).
She takes her seat next to Markham and gives him a significant look, "Baali. How are you tonight, darling?"
"Fine."
The Malk keeps her eyes fixated on the Baali for a few more moments. She narrows them and whispers something to herself. Then, she sits back and waits for the others to come in.
Clarice says to Markham, "I see you have come here for a purpose, my dear. But things have taken an unusual turn over the past few nights, yes?"
"Something like that. What's it to you?"
Clarice clicks her tongue, "Come now, I am your friend. As a Malkavian, I see things that elude others."
Markham blandly replies, "Save it for the kiddy party. I know how...crazy and unhinged you Malkavians can be."
Clarice shakes her head in a very gentle manner, "Now, now. Generalizations do no one any good, Markham. I am willing to help, provided you step up and ask." She sounds a lot more distant with the last line.
Markham lifts his chin a little, "What would you possibly know? I once had a Malkavian 'prophesy' that I was gonna get a promotion in a few weeks' time. Needless to say, it didn't pan out. I have yet to meet a Malkavian that hasn't had a vision of some sort that was just utter nonsense."
The Gangrel Primogen is cracking up, "Hahaha. Oh, shit! Hahahahahahaha!"
Clarice remains calm, like the schoolteacher she once was, "I am sorry to hear that. Yes, it is true, some of what we see does end up being nothing more than a load of hooey, yes--"
She fixes her gaze on the Baali, "--but there are times when our visions and dreams prove to be of the utmost importance. I implore you to keep an open mind, darling." She wears a faint smile as she tells this to Markham.
Sheriff Velma tells the Malk, "Heh, maybe you can help find out more about those hitmen who are still, in all likelihood, after him."
Clarice gently bows her head, "I will do my best, Sheriff DuPont. Then again, what use is my help if this man does not first reach out and ask. How can I know if a student has doubts if they do not lift their hand or speak? Contrary to what you might've heard, I am no mind reader."
Markham folds his arms and plainly says, "I'll keep it in mind. Roxanne's my prime focus right now." His tone is matter-of-fact, and it's obvious he doesn't want to go through this whole song and dance right now.
Dr. Collins notices Clarice's brief smile faltering at the mention of Roxanne's name, but he doesn't know why.
Clarice's lips quiver and she mouths off, "Roxanne. Brujah Clan. A prostitute by profession. Pricey compared to other harlots in the city. She's the only one who seems good at what she does- whoring. But...yes, g--good at what she does." Her expression is more melancholic than before.
Markham asks the Sheriff, "She knows where to find her?"
Sheriff Velma shrugs, "Ask her, not me."
Markham shoots the Malkavian Primogen a look, eyebrow raised.
Clarice sighs, "I know of fellow Seers who regularly...sleep with her. I'll speak to them when I get the time."
"Thanks."
Clarice snickers, "Oh, don't mention it."
There seems to be some kind of a raucous coming from the other end of the room, some sort of...yelling.
Prince Antonio gets up and his face scrunches in confusion, he gestures for the Sheriff to go and see what all the hullabaloo is about. Sheriff Velma does so without a moment's hesitation.
There's a lot of muffled voices and shuffling noises coming from that direction, like some kind of brawl. The Gangrel Primogen gets up and is about to say something when a whole load of people come in.
Right at the front stands a man who is bulky and muscular. He's got medium-length blonde hair, dark-blue eyes, a scarred face, and a stern expression.
Behind him are 2 other guys, one's got an eyepatch, a large scar, and a whole lot of piercings, while the other one looks like a fucking brick shithouse, all rippling muscles, a hard wall of a man.
The man in the front speaks with a gruff British accent when he steps forward, footsteps heavy and firm, "Alright, this the place, eh? 'Cause this better be the right place and the right time, you lot." He stands at the entrance with his hands on his hips.
Pedro shoves past and makes the introductions, "Uh...this is the um...Brujah delegation. Prince Antonio, err...I told you that they were ready to integrate with the Camarilla..."
The guy in the front cracks his neck and rolls his shoulders a few times. He raises his chin and introduces himself, "Name's Clive. Former Anarch. I'm done with those tossers. Now, I wanna throw me lot in with the posh 'uns at the Ivory Tower."
Pedro motions towards Sheriff Velma, "This is Sheriff Velma DuPont. Clan Ventrue."
The Sheriff keeps her cool and looks at all the Brujah that are now crowding-up the joint. A lot of them are busy mumbling and talking amongst themselves.
They all look tough and battle-worn. Sheriff Velma suppresses the urge to sneer in contempt.
She politely offers her hand out to Clive, "Sheriff Velma DuPont. Welcome."
Clive scoffs at her hand, "Pfffsht. We heard of you, love. What you did to those poor Thin-Bloods back in '99 was unwarranted."
Sheriff Velma plainly states, "No Thin-Bloods in this Domain. If you've got an issue with it, walk."
Prince Antonio chimes in, "Hey! You don't get to bring your gaggle of Punks to my fucking Elysium and tell me how to run shit in my Domain. I've been doing this for a 100 fucking years before any of you slabs showed up."
Clive seems to enjoy this and looks over his shoulder. The rest of his posse seem to be itching for a fight.
He tells them, "You heard that? Old boy's been running this gaffe for a bleedin' century now." He makes a big show out of clapping his meaty hands together. The other Brujah join in; some whistle and jeer at the Ventrue Prince.
Dr. Collins leans forward in his chair to get a better look. He's still a fair bit away, though. He feels very conflicted about this. He doesn't know what he should say or do in a situation like this.
Once all the mocking has died down, Prince Antonio bluntly asks, "You got my fucking money? Because that's the only way I'm letting you have a seat at the Primogen Council. Filthy fucking Anarchs." Those last 3 words have more venom attached to them than anything else.
Clive clears his throat and smacks his lips, "Yeah. Right, we've got your dosh. But, what guarantee do I 'ave that you won't go around changing the wee prices again, hmm? It's already the 3rd time you've fucked us over."
Prince Antonio doesn't let the towering Punk get the better of him, "It's called inflation. I gotta do what I gotta do. Besides, you clowns have been operating in my Domain, right under my nose, for YEARS! I can't let shit like that slide!"
Clarice joins these...troubling negotiations, "I still remain skeptical about allowing former Anarchs into the Primogen Council. Especially, those of you that are as...brutish as this group seems to be. The Camarilla is supposed to be about maintaining order. A degree of sophistication that I fear your kind just lacks."
She quickly adds, "No offense, of course."
Clive snickers to himself, "None taken, grandma."
Clarice softly laughs at that remark, "So you say. If you wish to be welcome into the Camarilla, then you must prove yourself in some way or the other. I doubt your money alone, no doubt a pitiful sum, would convince Prince Antonio to grant you all an official seat."
The Prince seems to agree with the Malkavian, "That's right! You all just wanna...waltz into MY fucking Domain, start demanding that I make YOU part of the Primogen Council."
He takes a few steps closer to the Punk, "It doesn't work that way."
Clive takes a few steps back and his hard expression softens a little, "I mean, you're asking me for 1 million US dollars?! That's a load of bloody bullshit, that is." His tone is accusing. He's not holding anything back.
Many Brujah behind him signal their agreement with grunts, murmurs, and nods.
The Prince glares at them. His expression is unreadable.
Clive asks the Ventrue Prince, "How the 'ell am I supposed to get that kind of dosh, mate?"
Prince Antonio looks at Clive like the guy's some kind of a moron, "I dunno? Go suck cocks, rob banks, punch massive holes in walls, tip over buses, y'know, whatever it is you fucking Brujah usually do to make money. I don't give a damn! You either give me what I want, or you fuck off back to wherever the hell it was that you came from!"
Dr. Collins turns around in his seat and makes eye-contact with the others. Clive beckons to the Tzimisce Primogen, "Oi! Who the 'ell are you?"
The good doctor stands up and introduces himself.
Clive bites his lip and nods, "A Tzimisce doctor, eh? Wow. Make any flesh furniture lately? Any extra appendages you attached to some unlucky sod?"
"No, I...don't do that sort of thing." The doctor's face tics when he says this.
Clive wears an almost smug expression, "'Course not, right. Of course you don't do any of that sorta stuff. Or would you? You know what a Vozhd is??"
Dr. Collin gulps and answers, "Yes. A creation of our Clan, mostly. A mishmash of living beings melded together into an elephant-sized, multi-limbed monster. Dozens of lobotomized Ghouls merged through Koldunic Sorcery and Vicissitude, resulting in...something truly horrible."
Clive takes a few menacing steps towards the mild-mannered doctor, "You ever make 1 of these fucking abominations or take part in the creation of 1, doctor?"
"No."
Clive puts his strong hands on the doctor's shoulders and repeats his question, "No, I don't believe you, lad. How can I believe you? I've seen you Tzimisce and what you've been doing to people, animals, and Ghouls in general."
Dr. Collins maintains a brave face, "I have nothing to do with the grotesque excesses of my Clan. I don't know why I should have to prove this to you or anyone else here." He doesn't dare to blink, however, his eye contact with the towering Punk falters at points.
Clive shoves the Tzimisce down to the floor and grunts, "If I ever catch a wee whisper of you taking part in anything remotely resembling the creation of a Vozhd, I'll fucking tear you apart, limb by fucking limb."
Dr. Collins promptly stands up and remains in his place. His expression has a bit of fear, but he seems to hold himself together pretty well.
With some bitterness and past trauma lacing his words, Clive explains to everyone present, "I've had me fair shares of running into Vozhds. I lost many good people- people I loved, cared about, and bled with- to those monstrous shites."
He shakes his head and painfully mutters, "Not again. I'm not losing anyone of me mates ever again."
Prince Antonio indifferently rolls his eyes, "Wow, real deep. Nah, Collins and the rest of the Flesh-Shapers in this city don't mess around with that kind of sick shit, now stop being a bitch and hand over my fuckin' money."
Dr. Collins shoots him an irritated glance.
Prince Antonio smugly tells Clive, "If it helps you sleep better in the day, then great. But, you want a seat at the Council, you pay up like everyone else here does. Speaking of, hey, Collins! Get over here."
Dr. Collins exhales sharply, grabs the bag of money, and makes his way to Prince Antonio. He feels uncomfortable being in such close proximity with the Prince, but he goes along with it.
The Ventrue Prince makes a grand gesture with his arms when he boasts to the crowd, "There you have it, ladies and gents. When I asked Collins here to get me my dough, he gets it. No complaints, no whining, no bitching, he just...brings it." He flashes a self-satisfied grin.
Dr. Collins just stands there, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else but here.
Clive grunts, but doesn't say anything. There's a small look of disgust on his face, however, as he sees the Tzimisce handing over the cash to the Prince. He keeps his thoughts to himself.
For now.
Prince Antonio opens the bag and perches an eyebrow, "10 grand, right?"
"Yes," Dr. Collins replies, in an equable manner.
The Prince snaps his fingers and orders his Sheriff, "Velma, go on and collect the cash from the rest of 'em. Chop-chop."
With a certain reluctant urgency in her step, Sheriff Velma goes to Pedro and holds out her cold hand. The Gangrel Primogen reaches into his back pocket and puts some money on her hand with a deep and frustrated sigh.
The Sheriff lifts an eyebrow, "That doesn't look like $5000."
Pedro bends down and reaches into his socks, he pulls out some more cash and slams it in her hand, "There. Hmph." His tone is biting and full of disdain.
The Sheriff thanks him and moves on to Clarice. The Malkavian Primogen gingerly reaches into her purse and produces the same amount in an envelope that has "MONEY" written on it in big, bold, letters. She gives it to the Sheriff with awan smile. There's a kind of sadness in her eyes when she looks at the other Kindred.
Sheriff Velma takes it all without comment.
Sheriff Velma hands over the money to Prince Antonio. The Brujah in attendance silently watch. Some murmurs and hushed whispers can be heard, however. There's an undercurrent of anger and discontent brewing among them.
Prince Antonio smugly accepts his tribute money and raises his chin, "Now, you, Velma. $2500. C'mon, chop-chop, I don't have all night."
The Sheriff produces a few crispy dollar notes that look like they're straight from an ATM. She hands it over to her Prince with a cold look in her eyes. Prince Antonio accepts it with a smirk. He turns towards the Brujah with a wide, self-satisfied grin and fans himself with the money.
"This is how I run my Domain. THIS is how I've been running it for the past 100 years. Capeesh?"
Clive folds his arms and stifles a groan, "Cor blimey. You got these sods all wrapped around your cold, dead fingers, huh? It's a bloody extortion racket, mate!"
The Prince refuses to back down, "Call it whatever you want. If you want in, then this is the way. Antonio Black doesn't do shortcuts."
The Brujah points to Markham, "How come that brooding guy over there hasn't coughed up any dosh, eh? Oi, you!" With that, Clive trudges over to Markham and takes a seat next to the Baali. He keeps a few feet between them.
Markham plainly answers, "I'm not from around here and I have nothing to do with this. To be honest, I don't even know why I was called here tonight."
Pedro angrily cuts in and growls, "He's a fucking Baali."
Clive thoughtfully nods and scowls, "Baali, huh? The same pet-kidnapping and murdering fucks who've been running around this city for decades now?" His voice has an accusing tone.
Markham looks at him and says, "I am not one of those. I am not responsible for their actions and I have nothing whatsoever to do with any of that."
Clive prods, "Ah, so you say. What's your story, then? Why are you here if you got nothing useful to contribute?"
Markham shrugs, "I was told to be here by the Sheriff. Don't read too much into it."
The Punk scoffs, "Aye. A man of few words, eh? Fancy yourself the strong, silent type, eh?"
Markham is unperturbed, "Something like that." He looks straight ahead. His expression is neutral and nonchalant, it's hard to tell what he's thinking.
Clive closes the distance and puts his burly, meaty hand on Markham's shoulder, "What do you do for an Unliving, mate?"
"I work for the SEC."
Clive repeats, "The SEC. The SEC, huh? So, you're a finance cop, eh? Getting stuck in all that stock market shite, investments and the like. You ever get some pain in yer napper?" He taps the side of his head when he asks this.
Markham dryly responds, "Sometimes." His voice is bland and emotionless. It's hard to tell if he's being sarcastic or not.
Clive shoves the Baali a little and throws his head back, "Ahhh, fine, don't talk. Keep your little secrets, Mr. Baali SEC Man." He gets up and takes a seat in the back with his other Brujah buddies.
As Clive is about to leave, Markham asks, "You know anyone by the name of Roxanne? She's part of your Clan."
Clive stops in his tracks and his face scrunches in confusion, "Roxanne? Never heard of her, pal. Oi, any of you wankers hear of any bird named Roxanne?"
Surprisingly, every single Brujah in this dilapidated and decrepit music hall says, "NO!"
Markham seems surprised by this, "But, she's Brujah like you..."
Clive shrugs indifferently, "Never heard of her, bruv. What's so special about this bird, anyway?"
Sheriff Velma dismissively answers, "She's a hooker who's pricier than most. That's all." She sounds a bit annoyed by it.
Markham simply says to Clive, "Thanks, I guess."
Clive nods back and leaves to sit with his other Brujah cronies, "1 of us, a whore? Bloody 'ell. How the Learned Clan has fallen over the decades. Pfft."
The other Brujah whisper and say something or the other to each other. Some are likely eager to know more about this Roxanne and maybe...elicit her services. A few of them rub their hands together and growl in a very suggestive manner.
Clive snaps at them, "Oi! Stop it! If this Roxanne bird wants, she can find us."
Sheriff Velma points out, "They say she's got her ears for the streets of this city--"
Clive interjects, "WE got our ears for this city, not some fucking unknown slag."
The Sheriff narrows her eyes and continues, "Don't interrupt me ever again. This isn't some biker hangout where you sit back and drink forties and howl like maniacs. At Elysium, you're expected to maintain some sense of decorum...and class, which you people clearly lack."
The Brujah clicks his tongue defiantly, "Alright, love, alright, calm your tits. Like I was saying, if this Roxanne slag wants to do business with us, she can come and see us herself. I'll be happy to get to know her better."
Clarice shakes his head, "I doubt she'll be too pleased to work with you...clowns."
Clive mockingly asks, "I beg your pardon?"
Clarice repeats herself, plainly and without hesitation, "You Brujah have devolved into nothing but a bunch of unrefined barbarians. Your...muscles will get you nowhere with a shrewd woman like Roxanne." She wears a subtle smile when she tells him all this.
Clive snickers, interlocks his fingers behind his head, and leans back, "Oi, that's rich coming from a batty old lass." He winks at the Malkavian Primogen.
Dr. Collins takes a seat next to Pedro and inquires with a whisper, "Is it always this...lively?"
Pedro softly chuckles, "No. THIS is actually pretty tame compared to what it was like a few years ago. Back then, the Ventrue would openly fight each other in here--"
He points to some scratched walls on the left side of the hall, "Back in the 80s, a couple of amigos absolutely lost it and started bashing up the place. Killed 2 of their Ghouls, right there. One of them had a big-ass hole in the chest and the other one was shot in the neck, bled out in minutes."
Dr. Collins grimaces, "Goddamn."
Pedro adds, "Yeah, your Galeb was here that night."
"Hmm."
Prince Antonio gets back on his throne in the front and impatiently waits for Pierre to arrive. He repeatedly checks his watch, groaning and huffing in an annoyed fashion.
"The fuck is this Frenchie? Velma!"
Sheriff Velma blandly shrugs and suggests, "Maybe we should just go on. You know how moving around in this city is."
Prince Antonio lazily waves his hand, "Yeah, yeah. No need to gimme a lecture. Oh, boohoo, traffic sucks. Oh, waaa, it's too congested. Well, get a bigger car, you fuckin' losers." He doesn't seem to be directing that jibe at anyone in particular, it's just the general direction of the room.
Clarice retorts, "That's hardly the solution, Prince Antonio. It would only worsen things and make it even harder for pedestrians. As it is, Flimont City has 1 of the worst pedestrian fatality rates in all of the Midwest and that's saying something." Her tone is disapproving.
The Prince snarls at her, "Shut the hell up! I didn't ask you, Kook! If I wanted your input, I'd ask for it. And again, use your inside voice."
Clarice sighs deeply and puts the side of her head on her knuckles. She doesn't seem too thrilled to be here (or to have parted with $5000).
Dr. Collins chimes in, "She's right, y'know. Pedestrian deaths are very common. People don't know how to drive or they're in a hurry. It's a vicious cycle." He doesn't look at the Ventrue Prince while he says this.
Prince Antonio huffs, "What is this?! A fuckin' city hall meeting? Shut up about the fucking traffic and the pedestrians and shit! Right now, I wanna see that Brujah cough up some fuckin' dough."
Pedro clicks his tongue and goes to speak with Clive, "Amigo, you uh..."
Clive shoots the Feral a baleful glance, "This is not what we agreed to. When you said you were ready to facilitate our entry into the Camarilla, you never told us it was gonna be this bloody extortion racket."
Pedro is about to say something but stops himself. He tries again, but nothing comes out. Finally, he apologizes, "I--I'm sorry, OK? I didn't know he was going to charge you...THIS MUCH! A million dollars is an outrageous amount of money, man!"
Clive scoffs, "Oi, so you say. But you ain't the one who has to pay it, are you?"
Pedro huffs and turns to Prince Antonio, "C'mon, hermano, make a little room, yeah? A million dollars is just way too much, man. Maybe you can lower the price a little? Please?" He sounds desperate and his expression is pleading.
Prince Antonio is unmoved, "Nah, I don't think I will. These slimy fucking Anarchs gotta learn that they can't come into MY Domain and fuck with ME." His tone is harsh, angry, and uncompromising.
He points to Clive, "You want in, then you pay up like everyone else!"
Dr. Collins cuts in, "It's clear this kind of back-and-forth is getting us nowhere. A million dollars is outrageous. Hell, even the money I was...asked to bring tonight was just as outrageous. You have no right to demand this kind of money from us."
Prince Antonio narrows an eye, "Wise guy, huh?"
Dr. Collins replies, "That's not what I meant. I'm just saying that these arbitrary charges are...unnecessary. Why does the Primogen Council even owe you money in the first place? Y--You even take money from your own Sheriff." His tone is firm, but not unkind.
The Prince leans forward and snarls, "All your fancy doctor degrees don't mean squat cause I'm the Prince around here. ME! It's how I've run this Domain and how I always will. Galeb never had a problem with bringing me my money when I asked for it. And look at how far he got."
"Galeb was quite a wealthy man," Dr. Collins reminds him.
Prince Antonio lifts his chin, "So, get wealthy too. It's the American Dream, isn't it?"
Dr. Collins claps back, "The more I see of this city, the more suffering I witness, the less I believe in those fairytales sold to me when I was younger."
Prince Antonio ignores that and waggles a finger at the Tzimisce Primogen, "Don't be a wise guy, Collins. And you're still gonna help find Galeb. Remember that?"
Dr. Collins groans and says, "I'm doing my best, but we haven't seen hide nor hair of him ever since. I think we should just accept the fact that he's been Beckoned off."
Clarice concurs with this assessment, "It's the only logical conclusion to draw. He was an Elder, after all. But, if it makes you feel better, I'll talk to a few Seers and see if they can give us any insights into the matter." Her tone is very gentle and considerate.
Prince Antonio turns to Pedro and asks, "What about you? What do you think happened to Galeb?"
The Feral Primogen shrugs elaborately and doesn't answer. Markham shifts in his seat, maintaining his look of indifference and aloofness.
Prince Antonio slams a fist down and curses, "FUCK! We can't just go on like this forever, people will start wondering."
He grits his teeth and desperately says, "I NEED Galeb to get his ass back here!"
Clive joins in, "Why? What's so special about him?"
Sheriff Velma gives Clive a dirty look and grunts, "It's not our place to question Prince Antonio. So shut up and listen when he talks, alright?"
Clive sarcastically replies, "Yes, mum."
The other Brujah snicker and cackle at this.
Clarice sighs and shakes her head. Dr. Collins looks like he'd rather be anywhere else but here. Markham looks as uninterested as ever.
Pedro remains uncertain, since he's the one who's facilitating the entry of the Brujah into Prince Antonio's Court, but the Prince is being as belligerent (and greedy) as ever. It's going to take a lot of convincing and persuading on Pedro's part to get the Prince to lower the price for Clive's seat at the table.
He tries, "Look, hermano, I'm willing to chip in more money if I have to--"
Prince Antonio holds up his finger, "Lalalalalalala. No. I don't do the whole 'on behalf of someone else' shit. The money HAS TO come from Captain Steroids over there." He points to Clive.
Clive grits his teeth and folds his arms.
Pedro tries again, "Yeah, but you can't expect him to cough up a million dollars, man. People in this city barely make enough to--"
Prince Antonio raises his voice, "Lalalalalalala. Stop it. Don't. I don't give a shit about any of them- I've heard that sob story a million times and it's starting to get old. Right now, my only concern is getting my fucking money- a million bucks."
Pedro sighs and slumps down, he puts his hands on his face and groans.
Clarice shoots a disapproving look at the Ventrue Prince.
The Prince glares back, "The fuck you staring at me like that for, huh? I ain't some student of yours who got his hand caught in the cookie jar, alright?"
Clarice grimly declares, "Your incessant and insatiable greed, Prince Antonio Black, will be your undoing."
Whoa.
The Prince springs up from his comfy seat and angrily points to Clarice, claws extended, "OK, you listen to me, you crazy-ass Malkavian bitch! I'll have you and every-fucking-one of you thrown out of this Domain if you don't shut the fuck up RIGHT NOW!"
Clarice raises her head in an almost (but not quite) defiant manner. The Prince's face is twisted into an expression of fury and rage. It's quite a sight to behold.
Clarice simply says, "I speak what I see, Prince Antonio. Even after all these years, what you do with that money we give you remains a mystery to us all. But, I can safely and confidently conclude that none of it is spent on or for the betterment of Kindred Society."
The Prince is practically seething, so much so that Sheriff Velma steps in and chides the Seer Primogen, "Clarice. Can. It. Right. Now. You crossed a line, OK? Don't forget that it is HE who makes the rules here. We do what HE says, whether we like it or not."
Dr. Collins is at a loss for words, but he's clearly uncomfortable. Markham seems to be taking this in stride.
Clive laughs out loud, "Oh, blimey! This shite is getting good!" He and his gang are thoroughly enjoying the political (shit)show.
"Shut up, Clive!" Sheriff Velma yells at him.
Clarice mockingly mimes zipping his lips shut and he even makes a show of tossing the invisible key to a mate of his. The other Brujah "catches" this nonexistent key and swallows it like a pill. She giggles to herself.
Prince Antonio takes a deep breath and calms himself down, "Right, I'm calm, alright? I'm calm. No more yelling. We're--We're all friends here."
Dr. Collins mutters softly, "Friends who pay each other and themselves a lot of money, apparently."
The Prince sucks some air through his teeth, "Collins, don't. Just--don't. You don't know half the shit I put up with every night, OK?"
Dr. Collins, ever the man of medicine, offers, "If there's something ailing you, come by the clinic and I could--"
The Ventrue Prince holds up a stern finger and shakes his head, "No, nuh-uh. I'm fine, f--fine as can be, doc. Don't even go there, alright?"
Pedro softly remarks, "There's no shame in admitting when you need help, hermano." His tone is sympathetic.
The Prince is about to say something, but he stops himself. He looks up at the ceiling and bites his lip, he seems to be holding back some very strong emotions.
Sheriff Velma puts her hand on his shoulder and gives it a little squeeze. She proceeds to tell everyone present, "We're gonna take a short break. When we come back, hopefully, we'll be ready to move on."
Clive loudly hollers, "Fuck that! It's clear this is going no-bleeding-where. I don't 'ave a million dollars lying about. Even together, none of us 'ave that kind of amount!"
He gets up, dusts himself off, and adds, "We're leaving this dump. C'mon, lads, lasses. I don't know how you lot put up with this tosser, I--I really don't."
u've fragile ego, mate.
