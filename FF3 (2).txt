Chapter 10: Hey, Rock Star
The sun rises. Another day dawns in Flimont City. Some people wake up hungover, others wake up to a nice surprise, some wake up feeling happy and fulfilled, others wake up feeling sad and lonely.
A few wake up feeling absolutely nothing at all.
Flimont City, despite its cheery disposition (at first glance) and the promise of a bright, fresh, new start, is not as great as everyone would like it to be. 
It's falling apart at the seams (literally and abstractly) and the latest developments have essentially given the cops a pretext to declare war on the entire population, essentially acting as some sort of occupying force (as if they weren't already) and treating everyone, especially the poor and needy, like fucking savages.
The police chief calls yet another press conference and doubles down on his threats as the Governor stands aside, nodding silently.
Nothing too great happens in the morning. LDJ lounges in his joint, he goes for a joyride, stops by for a quickie with Sophie, and then heads back home to crash.
Paul enjoys a few lines of his white powder. He then goes to crunching a few numbers and making sure that the accounts are in order. He does a little light exercise, takes a shower, and goes to bed as the sun begins to descend beneath the buildings.
Once the sun has completely set, the sky is bathed in this ethereal shade of orange. It's beautiful, but it also carries with it an ominous and foreboding feeling. The nights in Flimont City aren't always friendly and welcoming.
Sometimes, the darkness is just...there.
And, sometimes, that darkness has teeth. Sharp teeth, fangs one might call them. And sometimes, that darkness isn't afraid to bite. To take without thought for consequences.
After all, it's a world of darkness.
In times like these, the Masquerade is in a fragile spot, but Prince Antonio Black and Sheriff Velma DuPont are more than capable of handling whatever comes their way.
Of course, the former has run the city for a 100 years and the latter has been at his side for the past 50. They have the experience, the connections, the intelligence, the power, and the patience. They know the score and they've played it well for so very, very long.
There's a reason the Ventrue are also known as The Clan of Kings.
Anyways...
Diego the Gangrel stirs from his day-sleep. Marisol awakens a minute later. He stretches his cold and stiff limbs, yawns, and slowly gets up. His joints crackle. He grumbles, "Oh, god."
Marisol blinks and wipes the blurriness from her eyes. She groans and wraps her cold arms around her boyfriend's chest. He turns and kisses her on the cheek, "Good evening, mi corazon."
She smiles and responds, "Hey, D. Rest well?"
Diego laughs, "Of course! Did YOU snooze well?"
She nods, "Uh-huh."
He scratches his head and asks, "So, you gonna go to work tonight or skip?"
Marisol exhales sharply, "If I take another 'sick' day, I won't have a work to go back to. You know how it is, D. Without this job--"
Diego pulls her closer and gives her a gentle peck on the forehead, "I know, I know. Your abuela's house, our Haven, is all we've got."
"Hmph, yes. And how about you? Still going to play chaperone for that Baali Gringo down in the basement?"
"Yeah, heh heh. Markham is...an interesting vato, I'll give him that. I think he might need me to drop him near some neighborhood so he can look into something. Also, I have to check on the others. I hope they're doing OK, Marisol. These fucking cops never got along with us busters, now..."
She grimly finishes his thought, "...it's only going to get even more worse, huh? Hmph."
Out of concern, Diego, strokes his girlfriend's cold cheek and asks, "Your uh...driver's license all fine? And you got a good helmet, right? You can always take the pickup if you want."
Marisol presses her lips into a thin line, "It's fine, D. And what about you? Is YOUR stuff up-to-date and valid?"
He laughs and ruffles her hair, "Pfft, of course! I got a whole bag of tricks ready if they come after me, girl. We're fine. We're survivors, we're Gangrel, we've made it this far."
Marisol's expression falters, "I just want to make sure that everything's OK, D. I...I know that things have been tough and all, but--"
Diego reassures her, "Listen, it's all gonna be OK. Like I said, we're Gangrel- we got them Survival Instincts and ain't no busters ever gonna get the drop on us, alright? C'mon, you'll do fine at your job and I'll see you soon."
He looks her straight in the eye and smiles, "Don't worry about me, baby. I'll be alright. You just stay safe out there, OK?"
"I love you, D."
"Love you too." The 2 Ferals share a sweet kiss and get ready to go on with their night.
After showering, Marisol puts on something a bit more formal- a cream-colored blouse and some tights. She accessorizes with a few earrings and applies some light makeup.
Diego goes for a checkered shirt (not tucked in) and a pair of baggy, but faded chinos. He puts his cap on backwards and applies some Axe deodorant. He got into Axe Body Spray after seeing this extremely cheesy commercial on the telly.
Markham rises from his day-long slumber and takes a brief shower. He wears a white shirt (tucked in, but no belt), a long black coat, and a pair of trousers. He runs a comb through his hair and meets his 2 Gangrel hosts upstairs.
Diego stretches out his hands, "Heeey, lookin' good, devil man! You rest easy, homes?"
Markham is his usual self, "Mm-hmm. And uh...how did you both sleep?"
Diego grins, "Fine, just fine. So, what's the agenda for tonight, huh?"
Marisol grabs her things and prepares to head out. She gives her boyfriend a quick kiss on the lips, gets on her scooter, and zooms off, the sounds of her wheels fading into the distance.
Markham puts his hands in his pockets and shrugs, "I have a few places I wanna look into tonight. Y'know, Diego, I can always rent a car. I have the money..."
Diego shakes his head, "Nah, hermano. I like taking you around this place. Besides, with how shitty everything is right now, having a Gringo like you in the passenger seat just might save me from being pulled over by the cops, y'know what I mean."
The Feral quickly adds, "Not that I'm using you or anything like that- don't get the wrong idea, homes. But, I mean, with the recent stuff happening, it's kinda hard not to seen as a suspect just because of who I am, y'know? Anyway...so, where to first?"
The Baali plainly answers, "Sunnyvale."
Diego whistles and grabs his pickup truck keys from off the table near the front door. He sits on a nearby stool and puts on some scuffed loafers. After some effort, he manages to shove his feet into them.
The Gangrel and his guest climb aboard the somewhat old, but highly dependable, pickup truck. Diego turns the ignition, the engine sputters, and the vehicle lurches forward. After a bit of pestering, the engine settles and they head off.
As they drive, Diego asks, "So, what's so special about this Sunnyvale place, hmm?"
"Like I told you last time, someone I spoke to was living there."
"Hmm, yeah, yeah. I'm not gonna drop you right in the middle of that place. Reasons. Um...that OK with you?"
Markham shrugs, "Sure. And where are we gonna feed for tonight?"
Ah, the eternal question on the mind of any Kindred regardless of Clan, Bloodline, or Generation. Where's the next sanguine delight gonna come from?
Diego's eyebrows shoot up and he sucks some air through his teeth, "Normally, we'd hit some of our usual spots, but with all these fucking cops crawling around like cockroaches, it's better to go further out and look elsewhere."
He takes his eyes off the road for a moment and reassures, "But, I'm a pro at finding places with warm people. So, yeah, no worries, devil man. It's cool, we're good."
Markham is sitting back, his arm resting on the door. The wind is blowing his hair back. It's not entirely unpleasant. There's also not as many cars as there usually are.
Even Diego is taken aback by this. With wide eyes he remarks, "Whoa...in all my time in this city, I can't even think of a single time when a stretch of road was this...traffic free. It's wild, man. Wild."
Markham nods along, "Back in Seattle, the traffic never got as crazy as it gets here."
"So, how is Seattle, hmm?"
"It's alright, I can't complain."
The drive goes on, the streets aren't as lively as they usually are. The cops are seen every half-mile or so, weapons at the ready, a look of paranoia and spite clear on their faces.
In a few minutes, the duo arrive at the edge of the neighborhood known as Sunnyvale- it is, in essence, a typical suburban neighborhood like the ones oft seen in movies and shows set in or around such locales.
Diego slows down and pulls up alongside a row of tall trees. He looks left, right, and then puts his pickup truck in park. His eyes dart around. The houses are lined up and nearly identical to one another. White picket fences and neat lawns, etc.
The lights in most of the homes are either off or dimmed. The streets are quiet, the roads are empty, and there's a slight breeze that blows a few stray leaves around. In the distance, an owl hoots and a few cars honk.
Markham unbuckles his seatbelt, opens the door, and steps out, "Alright. I'll call you when I'm done. And thanks."
Diego tips his cap, "No problem, buddy. Just be careful out there. I'm not gonna lie- this place is pretty sketchy, so watch your back. You even know where that buster lived?"
Markham blandly states, "I'll just find the yellow crime scene tape. Besides, I can disappear if things get tight."
Diego understands, "Ah, Obfuscate, huh? Invisible devil man, heh. If things get dicey, gimme a call and I'll go over the speed limit to come get your ass. Alright?"
Markham gives a small thumbs-up and closes the door shut. Diego rolls the window down and calls out, "Just uh...be careful, man. And watch out for cops!"
He drives off into the night, looking around every so often. He mutters, "Shit is wild." He speeds off down the road, the lights of the street lamps flitting by.
Markham keeps his head low and his cold hands in the pockets of his coat. Luckily, they were able to find a living "meal" on the way here, so the eternal Hunger has been sated and the Beast has been quieted.
For now.
The Baali begins walking forward, hoping to find Nicky Schroeder's house and see if there's anything interesting to glean. The neighborhood is eerily quiet and a little chilly. There's no one around, no movement.
A few tricycles are spotted here and there, but nothing much else. A dog growls and barks at the vampire, but he ignores it and moves along.
As he's walking, a woman emerges from 1 of the homes and heads to the front gate. She's carrying a paper bag and mumbling to herself.
Markham decides to try his luck, "Uh...excuse me?"
She looks like an ordinary suburbanite type- casual attire, tired look, average height and weight, blonde hair, indeterminate 30s.
The woman (mortal, presumably) gives the vampire a sideways look, "Yes? Can I help you?"
"I'm looking for a friend who lives around here. A Nicky Schroeder. Do you...know him by any chance?"
The woman softly gasps, a look of fear flashing across her face, "Ooh, um...did you hear about what happened to him?"
Markham feigns ignorance and shakes his head, "What? What happened?"
The woman takes a deep breath and says, "Well, um...it was in the papers. A home invasion gone wrong, they say. I'm sorry, mister...?"
Markham gives his fake last name just to be safe, "Beckett."
"Right, right. Mr. Beckett. His house is that way, the police still haven't removed all the tape, I think."
Markham thanks the woman and starts heading in the direction she pointed to.
He comes across a single-story, red-brick house. There's no police vehicles around, but the aforementioned yellow crime scene tape is still up.
The Baali takes a few looks around, making sure that no one's about to see him go through the backdoor of the home. He walks up to the door, lifts the tape, and goes through, closing the backdoor behind him.
He looks around and is greeted with an interior that is, well, typical of a regular home. The ex-journalist's home is quite neat and tidy, there's stacks of folders and files near a couch by the window.
Markham wraps his hands in a handkerchief (fingerprints and all that) and flips a light switch. Nothing. He checks a nearby window and sees the curtains closed.
There's no power, obviously. He turns his attention to the files and goes through them, hoping to find something more he could use in his case against LDJ and P-Money.
Markham stops in his tracks and sees a chalk outline near the kitchen. He notices a broken cabinet nearby and plenty of shattered plates and bowls and glasses.
If the surrounding disarray is anything to go by, then Nicky didn't go down without a fight, well, some kind of a fight. Or, about as much "fight" as you can put up against a professional contract killer.
He goes back to the files and looks through the contents. In a few minutes, Markham finds something related to Luciano Donovan Senior. Not LDJ, but the next best thing all the same.
It's a notebook full of details on the elder Donovan's dealings, his history in the city, and some interesting little tidbits about his current situation.
Markham already knows, like, 96% of this stuff and Nicky's handwriting is a mess of squiggles and scribbles only readable to the writer himself, but the ex-journalist clearly tried his best to gather as much info (dirt) as possible.
This is pretty much redundant info. Markham puts the notebook back where he found it and makes sure that the curtains are properly closed.
He goes through Mr. Schroeder's oak desk and finds a recording device. He presses play and it plays the last recording: "Met an interesting guy from the SEC...of all places. This one bought me drinks, paid for 'em too. Wanted me to talk about the Donovans. Well, I don't decline free drinks, so I sang."
Markham remembers that it was just a few nights ago when he was talking to Nicky in the bar of the Sheriton Grand.
The recording goes on after Nicky coughs and guffaws: "I got nothing to hide. Everything I told that guy was the honest, capital-T Truth. What he does with that is up to him. Truth be told, I've given up on the system ever bringing crooks like the Donovans to justice. Ah, I need another drink. Too many bad memories that need to be put back in their place."
The recording ends and Markham simply places it back into the desk. He does 1 last sweep, but can't really find anything.
He does find a small picture of Nicky and his siblings and a dead house plant.
As he's about to leave, the sound of an approaching car is heard. The Baali peers out the window and sees 2 police detectives (they seem dressed like such) get out and walk up to the front door.
Markham stays out of sight and waits. 1 of the detectives, a woman in her 40s, asks, "Why the hell are we even here?"
The other detective, a guy about the same age, remarks, "Because, it's our job, Nina."
Nina scoffs and ducks under the crime scene tape. She holds it up for her partner, "Since when do we give a damn about our 'job'? Besides, that's Nicky-fucking-Schroeder. He wasn't the biggest fan of the FCPD, Ross."
Ross clicks his tongue and walks on, "Tch, yeah. Either way, someone whacked him. Let's just...sniff around so we can at least claim expenses on the gas, hmm?"
Nina faintly chuckles and smirks, "Hmm, sure."
Nina turns the front doorknob and enters. Markham was too late to flip the light switch. For now, he hides inside a tight closet, his body pressed up against the coats and other odds and ends.
He listens intently. The 2 detectives start snooping around and making crass jokes about the dead man whose house they're in. Nina finds the recording device and starts playing it, "This thing still work? Huh. I'm gonna assume the answer is yes."
Ross pokes his head in and looks at the recording device, "Oh, cool..."
Nina shoots him a look and she hears the last recording. After it's done, she asks, "You think we should follow up on whoever this SEC guy is?"
Ross scoffs at her, "Absolutely not, Nina. We have enough shit on our plate with finding out who killed Officers Davis and Sanchez. Let someone else handle it. We have enough pressure on our asses, why add more, hmm?"
Nina looks around and puts the device back in its original place, "True. Still, it's a bit weird."
"What is?"
"Home invasions don't usually happen in a place like this. Even then, there's hardly anything valuable to steal."
To reinforce her point, she does a wide, sweeping gesture around the place, "I mean, just look at this place. It stinks of washed-up journalist, not easy target."
Ross disinterestedly motions for her to continue with her theory, "Oh, great, you're doing your thing. Again. Please, go on."
Nina sighs and does so, "We know he made a lot of enemies, right?"
"Mm-hmm."
"What if 1 of those enemies did him in and made it look like a home invasion gone wrong?"
Ross points out, "Half the city hated this guy, the other half gave him the stink eye after that whole episode with that tranny hooker and him going at it in a hotel room. Seriously, that video recording was nasty. Hilarious, but nasty."
Nina's lips curl in disgust and she mutters, "Ugh, fuck you for reminding me. Anyway, I'm still convinced that this was no random act. The house is untouched, barely a mess, little signs of a struggle, no forced entry, no ransacking."
"Maybe they panicked. Happens a lot around here, Nina." Ross absentmindedly walks towards a wall and leans against it.
He folds his arms and keeps going, "The city is a fucking mess, everyone's a fucking mess, and we're all a bunch of fucking messes trying to keep our heads above water, Nina. So, let's just go home and try to sleep for a little bit before we have to be up and out again."
Nina huffs and paces around. She leans over and looks at the chalk outline from a few angles, "I dunno, Ross. Something about this isn't adding up."
Ross's shoulders slump and he lets out a deep breath, "Fine. I'll bite. What is it? What's eating you?"
Nina looks around the living room, "You can barely call this a home."
Ross scoffs at her, "Tch, you can say the same thing about your place, Nina."
Nina lightly smacks Ross's arm, "Tsk, not like that, smartass. Look, I've been a cop for a long-ass time and I've seen what a real home looks like. This? It's more like a shithole apartment, or a place for the homeless to squat. Hell, even YOUR place has a little bit of charm."
Ross raises an eyebrow and says, "Hey, don't talk smack about the man pad, alright? The boys at the FCPD love my place, Nina."
Nina shakes her head and chuckles, "Yeah, the 'man pad'. What are you, 12?"
"Ha-ha. Very funny. Can we please quote-unquote 'investigate' so we can get outta here and back on the road? It's kinda nice, y'know, not having to wade through traffic every goddamn day."
"And who's fault is that, Ross?"
"Nobody's."
"Right, so like I was saying..."
Nina puts forth a few theories about what might've really happened. Markham overhears this and can't help but roll his eyes at how ridiculous they all sound.
She wildly guesses that it might've been the Russians, the Mafia, the Russian Mafia, the Cartels, or some other organizations and entities that don't have any presence in Flimont City whatsoever.
In the end, Ross just shakes his head and walks back out to their vehicle. Nina is left alone to ponder a bit.
The woman sighs and mumbles, "This is the kinda shit I hate." She rubs her temple and adds, "If we find out who killed you, Nicky, I'll buy 'em a beer, then I'll arrest 'em. Heh, sleep tight, loser."
She closes the door and saunters off to the vehicle. A few seconds later, the engines rev up and they're both driving off.
Absolutely useless.
Markham exits the closet and stretches. At least he wasn't made by those 2 clowns.
It's the little things that one ought to be appreciative about.
The Baali continues to look through Nicky's stuff. He finds an interesting little tidbit- it's a photograph of Luciano Donovan Senior and 2 other men flanking him. They're all huddled close together and looking directly into the camera, arms around each other.
The man on the right is Donald Trump and the man on the left is Jeffrey Epstein. Markham turns the picture over and spots the signatures of the 3 men along with the line: "To all our little secrets."
Jesus yikes.
Markham gulps deeply and places the picture back where he found it.
He finds a few more photos of the Donovan patriarch's many daughters. LDJ is pretty much the only son.
There's also a newspaper clipping with a picture of the Donovans standing behind the Governor as the latter gives a speech at some rally. This was taken not long ago.
"Hmm, no surprise there."
Markham Reed sighs deeply and blows a raspberry. He paces around the dead guy's house, but nothing of note jumps up at him. He makes sure to wipe down any surfaces (or things) he touched and quietly leaves through the backdoor.
The rest of the neighborhood is just as quiet. A cat is seen skulking through a trash can, but that's pretty much it.
Markham gets out his cell phone and dials Diego's number. It rings 3 times and then he answers, "Hey, hey, how's it goin', devil man? Done so soon?"
The Baali dryly answers, "Mm-hmm. I didn't find anything, Diego."
"I'll be right over, homes. Wait for me at the same place."
Markham's next destination is the dive bar where those hitters might be at. For this one, he definitely needs to be extra cautious and watch his back.
Those hitters are still onto him and they're not about to let go so easily. Even though he survived the 1st attempt, the 2nd and 3rd and 4th and 5th and 6th attempts are always lurking in the shadows.
The ride pulls up and Markham climbs in. The drive is silent until Diego puts on some Spanish rap and bops his head to the fire beats emanating from the speakers.
Markham sits there, his mind a million miles away. Diego looks at him and laughs, "You OK, hombre?"
"Huh? Oh, um...yeah. Just thinking about what happened with Nicky. 2 cops, detectives, showed up. Don't worry, I hid from them. They didn't even sound remotely interested in...doing their damn jobs."
Diego shakes his head, "Hmph, yeah, that sounds EXACTLY like detectives who work for the FCPD, alright. When it comes to shooting busters or planting some grass on some kids, sure, they're up for it. When it comes to solving crimes, nah, you're better off getting fucking Snoop Dogg to play the detective."
Markham faintly laughs and looks at the Feral. He shakes his head and says nothing. He goes back to blankly staring out the window and watching the city go by in a slow blur.
The lights of the buildings flit by, the city is bathed in an eerie shade of blue. It's dark and gloomy, darker and gloomier than usual.
Eventually, they arrive at the dive bar that Roxanne mentioned. Markham exits the vehicle, thanks his friend, and heads into the joint.
Diego pokes his head out and asks, "Hey, you want some backup in there?"
Markham turns around, "No, I can handle it. Take care, Diego. And thanks...for everything."
The Gangrel turns the keys and revs up the engine, "Alright. Be careful. Same deal: call me when you're done and I'll come pick you up, OK?"
"Got it."
Diego drives off, but doesn't immediately leave the area. He parks a few meters away and watches on, a hint of curiosity in those eyes of his.
The dive bar is a hole-in-the-wall type of establishment. It's dark, dingy, and there's a faint stench of cigarettes and cheap booze. The furniture is rickety and the floors are sticky.
The patrons are mostly a mix of locals, regulars, and drifters. They're hunched over their glasses, their eyes glazed over, and their expressions grim and unchanging.
Markham pushes the black door open and bends down as he enters, his head almost hitting the frame. He straightens himself and surveys the interior.
The bar is long and rectangular-shaped, with plenty of wooden booths and seats along the sides. There are some small circular tables around the area. A lone pool table is near the back, its green surface surprisingly clean and tidy.
A small TV is hung up on the wall with some sports game playing. The volume is low. No one seems to be interested in watching the game, but some others are occasionally glancing upwards.
A woman in her 20s, with shoulder-length brunette hair and wearing a black-and-white striped tank top, is cleaning a glass.
Markham looks her way and the woman smiles. She sashays over and throws a cloth over her shoulder, "What can I get ya, stranger?"
Now, Mr. Reed must be careful. He can't just announce, "I'm here to look for hardened contract killers who frequent this establishment. Can you please tell me where they are and what they look like?"
No, subtlety is required. He sits on a stool and gets another look at the bartender.
The woman's hair is a bit messy, her lips are painted with bright red lipstick, and her nails are trimmed neatly. She's a rather good-looking lady, but she's also carrying an air of weariness and exhaustion around her.
The Baali remarks, "Busy night?"
The woman weakly nods, "Mm-hmm. Summin' like that." Her Southern accent is prominent and it's pretty much impossible to miss. She doesn't even have the need to fake it.
A guy in nearby shuffles out of his seat and goes behind a corner, his head hung low, his clothes stained and his hair messy. The stink of stale beer, sweat, and cheap cigars follows him.
He pulls out his flip phone and dials a number. He keeps his voice low, but he doesn't know that Markham is a vampire with enhanced senses.
Mr. Strickland answers, "Mr. Red. Status report?"
Mr. Red clears his throat and almost whispers, "Target spotted, sir. Permission to engage?"
"Negative. Reconnaissance only."
"Understood, sir. Standing down."
Markham stiffens up when hearing Mr. Red's gruff voice. A moment later, a man walks in with 2 women. The 2 women physically block the exits with their sturdy bodies while the man, an ex-military looking type (it's a very distinctive stance), approaches Mr. Reed and takes a seat next to him.
This is not good.
He signals for the bartender chick to serve him a scotch and she quickly obliges, pouring a pint for him.
The assassin initiates a conversation with the Baali, "Long night, huh?"
"Something like that."
"Hmm, you're not from around here, are you?"
"No, I'm not."
"So, where are you from?"
Markham keeps his cool and answers, "Seattle."
The killer chuckles and downs his scotch in 1 gulp. He smacks his lips and asks for another. The bartender comes over, fills the glass, and goes off. He grins and remarks, "Fucking Seattle." He holds the glass to the light and stares at it for a moment. He continues, "Fucking Space Needle."
Markham raises an eyebrow, "That it?"
The man shakes his head and gives him a look that's half-friendly, half-intense, "Nah. So, what's a Seattle guy like you doing in the Midwest, huh?"
"Work."
"Mm-hmm. Work, huh? And what is it that you do?"
Markham lies, "I'm a travelling appliance salesman."
The hitter whistles and spins his glass around, the liquid sloshing about. He gives Markham a sideways look and asks, "Toasters, TVs, junk like that, hmm?"
Markham looks at him and bluntly states, "That about sums it up." He turns over and glances over at the other 2 killers. They both have their hands clasped in front of them.
The male hitter claps Markham on the back and says, "Don't sweat it, they're friends of mine. We all saw a ton of combat back in the day, and that part never leaves you...even after all the dust has settled."
The Baali simply nods along, "Right, sure." He glances at the man's hand, and sees a part of his tattoos. Markham faintly smiles and half-heartedly says, "Hmm, nice ink." His tone belies his insincerity.
The man rolls up his sleeve and shows more of it off. It's some kind of hardcore army-inspired imagery, the kind you'd usually see on these sorts of folk. Y'know, the usual. There's a couple of faded hate symbols and an odd skull or 2.
Very subtle, real subtle.
"Yeah, thanks," the hitter flashes a smile that's half-friendly, half-predatory.
Markham pushes his luck, "I am in need of...something and I hear that you're the ones who provide it." The other 2 killers glance their way and Markham notices it.
The mortal just laughs it off, "I don't know what you're talkin' about, buddy..." He pauses and takes a sip of his drink. He finishes his sentence with, "...appliance man."
Markham shakes his head, "I think you know exactly what I'm talking about."
"Maybe I do, maybe I don't."
The Baali must tread carefully lest he get discovered. He quickly mulls over a few approaches in his mind and comes to the conclusion that a mixture of subtlety and directness is best suited for the task at hand. He decides to go for a blend of both.
He leans forward and softly says, "You know exactly what I'm looking for. Plus, you don't seem like the kind of guy who's a big fan of small talk, so let's cut to the chase: I need someone taken care of."
The mortal assassin breathes in and out. For a moment, he twitches. He eventually says, "Well, I hear there's plenty of good retirement homes in the next county..."
Markham shakes his head, "Not that kinda 'taking care of'."
The hitter looks at 1 of the women near the exits. He flashes her a quick glance and she nods. She approaches the bartender chick and tells her something.
The bartender grumbles and leaves with the other woman. The door shuts behind them.
OK, this is going somewhere.
Mr. Red finishes his drink and goes to take a leak. After that, he mans the bar.
The hitter signals towards his colleague for another refill. Mr. Red makes a show of spinning a bottle of scotch and pouring it into 2 glasses. He sets them down and goes to another end of the bar.
Markham decides to get right into the meat of the issue, "I heard of you people. From a friend." He waits for an answer.
The hitter takes another gulp and exhales, "A friend, huh? Can you be any less vague than you are right now?"
"Names are for friends. We don't need that. I just need to know if you're capable of taking care of my problem."
"And what kind of problem is that, exactly, mister...?"
Markham gives his fake last name, "Beckett. Let's just leave it at that."
The hitter raises his glass and grins, "Nice to meet you, Mr. Beckett. I'll keep my name to myself. So, who is it that needs...taking care of, hmm?"
Without skipping a beat, Markham easily makes someone up, "My ex-wife...and kid."
The hitter sourly chuckles and downs his alcohol, "Oh, shit...well, uh, I'll be damned, buddy." He places his glass down and clicks his tongue.
Markham grimly continues, "They need to be 'disposed' of."
The hitter asks, "'Disposed of'?" He mimics Markham's intonation, but in a mocking manner.
Markham maintains his composure and nods, "Yes."
The mortal bites his lower lip and begins asking, "Does your ex own a firearm or have any military training?"
"No and no."
"Hmm, good. Makes our job easier. Usually. And how old's your kid?"
"3-years-old."
The assassin whistles and shakes his head, "Jesus. Yeah, it can be done, no problem-o."
Markham's brows knit together in disbelief, "What, that's it? Is it...that easy?"
The hitman nods his head, "Uh-huh. And what's her name, hmm, this ex-wife of yours?"
The Baali makes up a fake name, "Caroline."
"And the kid?"
"June."
The hitman faintly laughs and stares into his empty glass. He goes on, "That's good...so, um...OK. The thing is, there's a certain price for these types of things. I dunno if it's within the range of a travelling appliance salesman--"
"What's the rate?"
The hitman gives him a figure. He quickly follows up with, "This includes, you know...cleanup costs and shit, yeah? So, take that or leave that, bud."
Markham blandly states, "I can arrange the funds. Cash, check, or wire transfer?"
The killer shrugs his shoulders and declares, "Whatever's convenient for you, my friend. And where do the targets live now?"
Markham stops himself from answering and instead queries, "How do I know you're legit? How do I know you're not some kind of undercover fed? What guarantee do I have that you're not wearing some kind of wire, or that this isn't a setup?"
The hitter shakes his head, "Listen, it's...it's a risk you're gonna have to take with us, alright? It's just a risk you have to take, buddy. Sales guy like you must know a thing or 2 about risks, huh?"
Markham shakes his head, "I'm still not convinced." He pretends to leave, but the mortal grabs his arm and says, "Fine, fine. I'll...I'll--"
He unbuttons his trench coat and proves that he isn't wearing a wire. He even undoes the top buttons of his shirt and reveals more nasty, hateful tats on his chest, but no listening device or bug.
Markham grimaces at the Sonnenrad (Black Sun) tattooed over the hitter's chest. This isn't looking good. The hitter smugly adds, "See? I'm not wearing any fancy bugs or listening toys on my body. We're as legit as they come, Mr. Beckett."
Mr. Reed then takes a chance and tries his hand, "Alright. How about you tell me a few details about your...company or organization or whatever?"
The hitter buttons his shirt and clicks his tongue in a mocking manner, "Nope. No way in hell. You're a civilian, you wouldn't understand or appreciate the way we operate, the way we function as a...unit of sorts."
Markham remarks, "Oh, I just wanna know that my money is being put to good use."
The hitman nonchalantly explains, "We do things the exact same way they do in the military. Standard operating procedures, stake outs, intelligence-gathering, tailing the targets, learning their routines and patterns, et cetera, et cetera. And, to make sure things don't get botched up, we like to take things slow, make sure we got the job right and do it the first time."
He signals for a refill and adds, "If we fuck it up, well...we don't. Not really a good look on the ol' resume if you catch my meaning."
"Hmm. And you have no problem killing a woman and a child?"
The hitman grins and shakes his head casually, "None whatsoever. Hell, it wouldn't be my first time, heh. We're equal opportunity offenders, Beckett- niggers, spics, cripples, queers, beaners, retards, gooks, kids, helpless old folk...we'll whack just about anyone and everyone for the right price. Even little, tiny, 3-year-old girls..."
His eyes go blank and he loses focus. He mutters, "It's like a fuckin' Christmas present, and we're Santa Claus's elves, haha."
The Baali keeps up his cavalier act, but he is absolutely disgusted on the inside. How can all of it be THIS easy?
The hitman laughs, "Aw, come on, bud. What happened, she cheat on you? That why you want 'em both whacked? The kid not yours? Caroline leave you for a black guy or something like that?"
Markham has a distant look on his face, "Something like that."
"Hmm, tough luck, buddy. Tough luck. I experienced something similar to that a while back. Anyway, you still haven't told me where she and kid live."
"I think they moved to this city a week ago."
The hitter leans closer and scoffs, "You 'think'? I need to know if the targets are still around these parts or if they're not."
Mr. Red slides over and makes a show of polishing a few glasses, keeping his head down, his ears open.
Markham's shoulders slump and he grumbles, "They might still be. She...has a restraining order out on me, so I haven't been able to...uh...get close. I had a guy keeping an eye on 'em, but he told me he lost them in traffic a few days back. So, now, I'm here, asking for help."
The mortal licks his lips, "Music to my ears. Nah, don't worry about finding those bitches. We got our own system for tracking down the little lost lambs and givin' them a 1-way ticket to the slaughterhouse. You got a timeframe for this or is this some sorta open-ended thing, hmm? Do I have some sorta deadline, like in a business sense?"
"How about...the end of the week?"
"Aww, come on, Beckett, give us a bit more time than that, eh? It takes, like, I dunno, at least 10-12 business days to make the hits."
Markham sharply exhales and feels very uneasy and taken aback by this ominous discussion, even if the "wife and kid" are all made up. But, then again, there are real people in the world who have been murdered by the man sitting next to him.
A grim and sobering thought.
Markham nods along and says, "OK. Yeah, yeah. Take however long you need."
The hitter laughs, "Oh, shit. You're a riot, buddy. And what about money? It's what I work for. The Frenchies around here call it a 'raison d'être'. Fuckin' weird goddamn frogs. Anyways, how much we talking about here? In light of the new info, and the fact that we have to track 'em down, the price goes up."
Mr. Red turns the TV's volume up a bit. Markham shrugs and gives a ballpark estimate.
The hitter chuckles, "Nice try, pal. No. The real price, the actual figure, the one you'll end up paying at the end of the business day, is...this. What you just gave me is only an appetizer, just something to whet the palate and turn me on a bit."
He grabs a napkin and jots down an amount that reads: "$80,000"
Markham's eyebrows shoot up. Is this...the value of a human life to these scumbags?
The hitman snaps him out of it by saying, "Hey, buddy! Hey, are you still with me, hmm? Pay attention. Hey!"
"Uh...what? Um, yes."
The Baali is also trying not to make any kind of reaction that could make his true nature known to this killer, "Hmm, sorry. I need time to get the money."
The hitman nonchalantly declares, "Take all the time you need, my friend. Take all the time you need. You got a way for us to reach you when Caroline and June get their tickets punched?"
Markham glares at the hitman and says, "I'll find you."
He's about to leave, when the hitman lifts a finger and asks, "So, how did you hear about...us? About this place?"
Markham sighs and seats himself back down. He wiggles on the seat and finally manages to say, "Through word-of-mouth."
The hitman chuckles, "Is that right? And who's mouth would that be?"
The Baali refuses to answer, "Names are for friends, aren't they? And we're not friends. Let's keep things simple."
The mortal assassin tilts his head, "Fair enough. Well, it's been real fun chatting with ya, buddy. Now, I got other things to take care of. So, uh...you get out there and make money selling shit so you can make that payment, and we'll get things done on our end, alright?"
"Hm. Fair enough."
"Y'know, I'm actually on the clock right now." The hitter winks, pats the vampire on the back, and signals to Mr. Red to serve him another drink. He keeps his eyes on the barkeep.
The assassin gulps it down and leaves with the 2 women following in tow. Mr. Red stares at the Baali and remarks, "You haven't had anything to drink. A teetotaler, huh?"
Markham is still reeling from the discussion, "S--Something like that."
"Well, there's a place a few blocks over that does milkshakes, haha."
Markham heaves and gets off the stool, "I should get going."
Mr. Red shrugs indifferently, "Good luck. And don't worry, your wife and kid are already dead."
The Baali stifles a gasp at that ominous remark. He gulps deeply and briskly walks out the bar. Once he's outside, he breathes a sigh of relief, but the unease still remains.
It's as if the pit of his dead stomach is being gripped tightly by some unseen, unknown force. He clasps his head, mutters something, and starts pacing about.
"My god. It--it can't be this easy..."
Oh, but it is. This is America, after all. A violent and backward imperialist nation of endless warmongering that spans the globe and leaves nothing but misery, unending anguish, and suffering wherever it has operated (or will operate).
Is it, then, any surprise that the violence inflicted on peoples miles away is almost emulated (reflected, some might say) within the borders of this "great" nation itself?
The violence at home and the violence abroad are connected.
The hitter and his cohorts get in an inconspicuous sedan and drive off, going who knows where. Markham is still pacing around, still muttering.
"Maybe, just maybe...it's a trap? But why would it be? I know they're trailing me...but..."
His whirlwind of thoughts are interrupted by a stranger accosting him and asking for directions to the nearest hospital.
Markham shrugs and answers by saying he's not from around here. The stranger simply walks off.
Markham's lips quiver and he paces a tight circle. This...wasn't necessarily the America he grew up in. He doesn't remember it being this violent, this...individualistic and indifferent.
It was a different time, a different era. Things weren't exactly better back then, but THIS is a whole 'nother level of bad. Those halcyon days are never coming back because they never existed.
Markham tries his best to calm his nerves. He sits on a nearby bench and feels a lump in his throat. His Beast rouses and roars within him. Something else, something darker, also emerges and softly growls inside of him.
The Baali shuffles uncomfortably in his seat as his eyes dart around, as he checks for any signs of danger or...the killers coming back to perhaps finish the job.
Markham pulls out his Motorola flip phone and calls Diego, "It's...it's done. Meet me near the corner. I don't wanna be seen."
The Gangrel responds, "Oh, hey! Sure, sure thing, homes. Just uh...gimme 30 minutes, alright? Some stuff has come up and I really need to take care of it."
"It's OK. I can wait."
The call ends and Markham mills around before deciding to go on a long walk. His mind is filled with a 1001 things at once.
The killers. Their faces and demeanors. The casual, unspoken way in which that guy mentioned taking lives as if it's the most mundane and routine thing in the world.
Markham's cold, dead heart begins to stir once more. His Beast rumbles. It's ready for whatever may come next.
Hell, he almost felt like lunging forward and swiping his claws at that asshole from earlier. He could've easily taken on how many hitters were in that dive bar, but that would constitute a severe breach of the Masquerade.
For now, he has to string the hitters along and let them believe that he's just a Federal Government employee who managed to survive 1 of their own attempts at "killing" him.
This isn't good. This is really not good.
As he paces and walks, he passes by the hospital the stranger was inquiring about. A few police cruisers and ambulances are parked in front.
A few people in the nearby vicinity are also peering towards that hospital with great interest. Curious, he looks and spots an EMT team bringing someone out.
A flustered EMT announces, "PREP THE OR! STAT! OUT OF MY WAY!"
Another EMT asks, "What's the situation?"
"White male in his early-40s. Cuts and abrasions to the head, neck, chest, and arms."
The other EMT grimaces and mutters, "Damn!"
A couple of other people nearby talk amongst themselves. Apparently, the poor guy met with an accident and his car was totaled.
After an hour, Markham meets Diego near the corner of a busy street. The Baali made sure that he wasn't followed or tailed by any assassins. 1 was actually following him, but through masterful use of the Obfuscate Discipline, Mr. Reed shook them and disappeared into a crowd.
The Gangrel stops his vehicle, looks both ways, and pulls the door open, "Hey, d-man! Sorry for the delay. I had some things to deal with..." The Feral looks tired and worn out.
Markham ducks down and seats himself in the passenger's side, "Is everything alright?"
Diego nods, but there's pain and frustration on his face, "Uh, yeah, just some...problems, you know how that is." He lets out a long sigh, "Anyways, what happened, amigo? Are they...uh...whatever?"
The Baali nods, "Yes, the killers have been contacted. It was too...goddamn easy." He goes on to explain everything that occurred.
Even Diego is taken aback and he nearly loses control of the steering wheel a few times, "Mierda! What kind of sicko would wanna pop kids, man? That's some fucked up shit!"
Mr. Reed has an expression on his face that's somewhere in between anger and confusion, "I don't know what to make of it. Either these are extremely dangerous people or--"
Diego shakes his head, "That is EXACTLY who they are, homes. Extremely dangerous people, and extremely dangerous people are only as dangerous as their leader...or leaders."
Markham sighs, "I was hoping to find out more about their leader or leaders, but I felt so...uneasy, so disgusted with them, with...this...situation. I just needed to get out as soon as I could."
"Understandable. If it was me in those size-12 shoes of yours, I would've gone nuts and ripped that cabrón to shreds. N--Not that I enjoy doing things like that, but there's a limit, you know? There's a limit to how much crap we can put up with."
The Feral drives down an unfamiliar path, a more secluded area where he can better think and clear his head after a hard and arduous night. The night is still young, after all.
Diego says he has to fill up some gas as it's running low, "You don't uh...mind a little detour, homes?"
"No problem. We could use the fresh air."
"Hmph, we sure could. I--I can't even believe what you just told me, man. Killing kids for money is..."
Markham thinks out loud, "All kinds of fucked up and all kinds of wrong." He absentmindedly nods.
He looks out the window and spots a gas station, a fairly empty one with not much in the way of lighting, except for a few flickering outside. The nearby shop is dimly-lit, so Diego manages to park the vehicle and get out to fill some fuel.
After that, Diego goes in through the front door and pays the shopkeeper. He buys a few bags of chips and goes on his way.
What a vampire needs crisps for is anyone's guess.
Markham, who has a few moments to himself, looks out the window and tries to sort through his thoughts. These, in turn, are interrupted by a van zooming past and the Baali catches sight of a black blur whooshing past.
Diego climbs back and slams the door with more force than usual. Ever since picking Markham up, he's had a sour and grim look on his face. He seems lost in thought, like he's thinking about something intensely. Perhaps something happened?
The Gangrel is a bit distracted and Markham asks him, "You OK, Diego?"
The Feral groans and sighs heavily, "Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, man." His tone belies his lack of fineness.
Markham looks at the bag of chips and Diego answers, "Ah? This? It's...not for me, of course. It's for some kids I know..."
The Baali perches an eyebrow. Diego clicks his tongue and starts up his vehicle, "After I dropped you, I...you know what, never mind."
Markham gives the Outlander a sympathetic look and offers, "If something's on your mind, Diego, then you can talk to me." He pauses and adds, "Besides, I already owe you for taking me in despite all of...it."
Diego heaves and grips the steering wheel with so much force, it might actually snap in half. He lets out a deep breath and says, "Y'know, I'm just so tired of this shit, man. You...ever feel like that, too?"
Markham nods along and remarks, "Sometimes." He waits for Diego to continue. He can sense that the Feral needs to let off some steam.
Diego sniffs loudly and begins, "So, there was this vato who I had to drop off at the court tonight for his uh...immigration hearing. Nice guy. He's from El Salvador, like me. He's got familia back there- a wife and 2 little kids. He works hard to provide for 'em, y'know."
"Mm-hmm."
"So, yeah. I dropped him off and waited around for a bit. After he came out, I saw that he was real shaken up, he looked real pissed off and sad, man." He pauses and adds, "He um...told me that they grilled him nonstop and asked if he's ever had any gang affiliations or shit like that."
The Outlander scoffs, "Tch. Of course those pendejos had to pull that fucking card. They told him to come back at a certain date, but he's got other commitments on that date. He asked if it was possible to reschedule, but they shooed him off like he was a fucking garbage fly or some shit."
He shakes his head in disappointment and says, "It's so...fucking unfair, man. I--I don't know what else to say. It's just...just so goddamn frustrating. Grr!"
Markham pats the Outlander on the shoulder, "I'm sorry to hear that, Diego."
The Gangrel shakes his head in disdain and remarks, "It's like this goddamn country only wants our labor, not US. Not as people, not as...you know, human beings. It's just...it's just..."
His voice cracks and he takes a moment to compose himself. He sniffles and exhales deeply, "Sorry, man. I just...I'm just tired of it all."
Mr. Reed nods and looks out the window, "Yeah, I know the feeling all too well."
"I hate it here sometimes, Markham."
"I can see why."
Diego starts the vehicle up and drives off into the dark road. He opts for a more scenic route to ease his tension. The windows are all the way down and the night breeze hits the 2 Kindred and blows through their hair.
It's nice. It's cool. It's soothing.
Elsewhere...
The mortal assassin from the dive bar stops at a traffic light and dials his boss, Mr. Strickland. He waits patiently till he picks up.
"Status report, Mr. White." There's some cats meowing in the background of wherever Mr. Strickland is speaking from.
The hitter, Mr. White (a color-coded name), answers, "I spoke to the target. Sir, he asked if...we could take out 2 people for him."
Mr. Strickland faintly chuckles, "An interesting turn of events. Tell me everything, Mr. White."
Mr. White obediently recalls and recounts the conversation he had with Mr. Reed earlier on. He makes sure to include the details about the wife and kid. He even tells him about the price.
Mr. Strickland clicks his tongue and remarks, "Hmm, how intriguing. It appears that this 'Mister Beckett' is far more interesting than we initially thought, hmm?"
"Yes, sir. Do you think he's onto us?"
"What do you think, Mr. White?"
"I'm not paid to think, sir. I'm paid to follow orders."
"Exactly. Maybe he is onto us, or maybe he does have business for us. It is, indeed, possible for 2 things to be true at once."
"Yes, sir."
A blue-eyed Ragdoll cat jumps onto Mr. Strickland's lap and curls up. He scratches behind its ears and the feline purrs.
He continues, "Would it be prudent to proceed with our original plan or should we wait and see what unfolds?"
The hitman hesitates and stumbles over his words, "I..."
Mr. Strickland chuckles, "We will wait and see how this unfolds. If this is a business opportunity, passing it up would be a travesty."
"Yes, sir. It sounds easy enough- a woman and her kid. I want point on this op, sir."
"That, Mr. White, is not for you to decide. I will determine where and how and when my soldiers are deployed. Speaking of, your target is currently in the hospital- he met with quite a nasty accident and his car got totaled."
Mr. White squares his jaw, "They just have to go and make my job harder, hmm? I'm on it, sir. Also, there was...something else."
"Speak. I'm listening."
The hitter gulps and looks around before answering, "This Beckett guy or whatever his name really is...he felt...off?"
"Everyone feels 'off' to you, Mr. White. You're going to have to be a little more specific than that, soldier."
The assassin sighs, "He had the eyes of--of a dead man; I should know, sir. And he felt cold to the touch, like he sleeps in a morgue or right under a fucking A/C unit. It's just...unsettling. I felt so...different around him, sir."
"I see. Hmm, well, that's interesting. I'll make some calls and have our people do another check on his records."
"Thank you, sir."
"Oh, and Mr. White?"
"Sir?"
"Happy birthday. Your target is in the hospital. Goodnight and god speed."
"Thank you, sir." Mr. White hangs up and drives towards the location of his next hit. He carries it out with ruthless efficiency and expects to see the moolah in his account by sunrise.
Back to the 2 bloodsuckers...
There's some traffic near the freeway, so Diego pulls into the side of the road. The Feral puts on whatever's on the radio and lets it play as he stares out into the dark road ahead.
Markham asks, "Where are we going now?"
The Outlander shrugs and responds, "Anywhere else YOU gotta go, homes?"
"No, not really. I'm still...reeling from...that."
"Hmm, yeah. Even if your 'wife' and 'kid' were totally made up, it's still kinda hard to stomach all this shit."
Mr. Reed sighs and shakes his head. He mumbles under his breath, "This is not the America I remember growing up in..."
Diego hears that and scoffs, "Nah, nah. This is always what it's been, hermano. It's just gotten worse in this new century and all."
"Hmm, maybe. I'd still like to believe that the system works and holds such people accountable, but--"
The same van from the gas station zooms past Diego's pickup truck. Its black and has tinted windows. It nearly scratches Diego's pickup. The Gangrel curses and slams his fist on the dashboard.
He honks loudly, but the van keeps driving off at full speed.
"Puta Madre!" The Feral's eyes glow and he bares his fangs. The veins almost pop out on his neck and arms. Even his claws pop out.
This particular stretch of road is quite gravelly and not very well-lit. Diego slams his foot on the accelerator and chases after this black van. Markham holds on for dear Unlife as the Feral goes full-on Speed Racer on this thing.
The driver of the van doesn't seem to care about how fast they're going or how recklessly they're driving.
Diego's pickup truck manages to keep up with the van, but there's still some distance between the 2 vehicles. The Outlander repeatedly honks and honks in a bid to get the driver's attention.
The van speeds up and takes a sharp left turn. The Gangrel growls and follows after it. He's getting tired of these shenanigans.
Diego shouts, "They almost scratched my ride!"
Markham's face contorts into a look of concern. His Beast roars within him. He simply side-eyes Diego with uncertainty and says absolutely nothing.
Loud music emanates from the van. It's some kind of rock 'n' roll being blasted from the speakers. It's hard to tell if it's even good rock 'n' roll or not, though.
Diego growls and keeps up with the van. It makes a right turn and goes down an unfamiliar road. A few houses can be spotted in the distance, but it's mostly a bunch of trees, dirt, and gravel.
"Diego...you know you don't have to--"
Diego growls at Markham and refocuses his attention back on the road. Markham notices that Diego's face has slightly...changed. No words seem to be coming out his mouth and all he can do is grunt and growl.
That would, in all likelihood, be the Gangrel Clan Compulsion in action- their Feral Impulses. The vampire regresses to a point where speech is hard, clothes are uncomfortable, and arguments are best settled with teeth and claws.
Plus, there was that whole thing with Diego's buddy earlier, so that likely contributed to setting the Outlander off. Markham simply holds on to the window frame and makes sure his seatbelt is tight.
He whispers to himself, "I hope the airbags on this thing work."
Diego hisses and snarls at him, as if saying, "THEY DO!" He puts his foot down on the accelerator and goes faster and faster.
The van takes another sharp turn and enters a road that's a lot darker and more secluded. There are no lights, no street signs, nothing. Just an old and long-abandoned factory.
The van keeps driving and Diego's pickup truck keeps chasing.
"GRRRR! HFFFFRGFLHGHFGHERRRR!"
The van shows no sign of slowing down. Markham gulps deeply and contemplates jumping out the car, but then again, that would be unwise at this speed. He decides to wait it out.
The van speeds up, but so does Diego's pickup truck. It makes a few more turns and eventually reaches the abandoned factory. The van pulls up and parks outside, next to a rusty fence and a large, metal gate.
Diego forces his door open and readies his claws. Markham's eyes widen and he steps out and tries to hold Diego back. The Feral snarls and shoves Mr. Reed away.
"N--No, Diego! STOP!"
The Outlander howls and prepares to charge at the van, but someone steps out, a guitar case slung over their shoulder. They look very familiar...
Diego hesitates and stands his ground, snarling and heaving. Markham stops in his tracks, as well, his eyes wide in shock and surprise.
"Hey, rock star," a familiar and hoarse voice of a man greets the 2 vamps.
Markham recognizes him as...as none other than Burt, his Sire.
The Baali has long, straight hair that goes down to his back. He has a wild look in his amber eyes. He's dressed in a buttoned-down short-sleeved shirt that's tight around his arms and dark skinny jeans with scuffed black sneakers.
His face is quite pale and very gaunt and he looks to be in his indeterminate 40s, possibly late-30s. He's got a necklace with a pentagram, and a few other trinkets hanging from his neck. He also sports a pointy goatee.
He's got that whole washed-up rock star vibe about him.
Markham gasps and is at a complete and total loss for words. Diego's more bestial side subsides and he returns to normal.
Burt smirks and looks at his Childe from head to toe, "Fancy seeing you all the way out here, kiddo."
Diego looks at Markham, then at Burt, and then back at Markham. He points to Burt, "You know this buster?"
Burt chuckles and takes a few steps forward. He leans against the side of his van and says, "Oh, I think it's a lot more than that...I Sired him. Saved him."
Diego raises his eyebrows and turns to Markham for an explanation. The Baali Neonate is still trying to process this unexpected reunion with his Sire.
Burt grins and extends his arms, "Don't be shy now. C'mere and gimme a hug!"
Markham takes a step back and holds his hands out, "No, no, it--it can't be."
Burt presses his chapped lips into a thin line and simply puts his hand on his Childe's shoulder, "Hey, hey. Easy, rock star. Easy there."
"I'm Diego, by the way. Clan Gangrel. You almost scratched my ride, man!"
Burt turns over to Diego, "Ah, sorry about that. The Clan of the Beast, huh? Wow, Markham, you're running with some real cool folk, huh?"
"..."
Burt nods and tells the Gangrel, "I'll pay you whatever for the scratches or...other damages. Sorry 'bout that, dude."
Diego folds his arms and says, "It's cool, man. I...we...can talk about it later. What brings you all the way out here?"
Burt shrugs and chuckles, "Oh, y'know, just a little road trip. I'm still looking for that thing. Rock star here knows what it is. I've also been playing at a few crappy bars for a few crappy dollars- this old rock star has still got some fight left in him."
Markham remains stunned and speechless.
Diego looks at him with concern and asks, "Everything alright there, homes? You look like you've seen a ghost."
Burt grins, "Heh heh, yeah. How ya doin', kiddo?"
Markham takes a deep breath and asks, "How--How did you find me?"
Burt shakes his head and stretches his arms out, "Find you? Markham, I didn't even know you were here! I thought you were still in Greenridge! I know you said you were applying for the SEC, but you never told me where that was or if you even landed the job."
Markham gulps, his head lowered in shame, "Sorry."
Burt frowns, "Aww, come on. Don't beat yourself up, kiddo. So, is there where you live now??"
"No, I'm not. I live in Seattle and I work as an Enforcement Investigator for the Securities and Exchange Commission."
Burt whistles and grins, "Not bad, not bad at all. Yeah, that whole fraud investigating thing you used to do was bound to get you caught if you kept on going with it. I know you, Markham. You don't do vacations, so, lemme guess...you're here for work, not the other thing, right?"
He's sharp.
Markham nods, "Yeah."
Diego interjects, "I'll give you 2 some space. I'll be waiting whenever you're done, alright, d-man?"
Burt chuckles, "D-man? The fuck is that?"
Markham dryly answers, "Devil man, because...y'know."
Burt dismissively waves his hand, "Ah, that's all rumors. Most Baali I know don't literally worship the actual devil. It's just a buncha crap that's been spread around, but most of the ones I know are fairly chill. They don't go around doing sick shit or whatever's being spread about us this week."
He gives his Childe a meaningful look, "Some of us are good people, too. But, then again, some of us are also total assholes."
Diego walks off and mumbles to himself, "Hmm, no arguing with him there." He gets back in his pickup truck and patiently waits for the 2 to catch up or whatever.
Markham avoids eye contact with his Sire, "The Baali here are monsters..."
Burt shrugs, "I see. Well, I haven't met them, let alone been here long enough to make any kind of judgment on them."
Markham is still trying to process this whole thing and he's not sure how to respond or react, "...What are you doing here, Burt?"
Burt gives his Childe a sidelong glance, "You really don't remember, do you?"
"I...I tried to forget it all. I did forget a lot of it. It's all hazy and jumbled. Sometimes, I get flashbacks and sudden memories, but...they don't make much sense to me. Nothing does."
"Well, I'm sorry to hear that, kiddo."
"What do you want, Burt?"
Burt futzes around with the guitar case slung over his shoulder, "What anybody else wants- to survive."
"That doesn't answer my question."
Burt sighs, "You're still as cold and withdrawn as ever, huh?" He chuckles, "Alright, rock star. I was passing by here and I felt like playing at the bars and clubs around here for a few bucks."
"That's not all."
"You're absolutely right. That's not all. I was tracking something, the y'know. A couple of guys might have it, so I'm on their tail, but I lost 'em a while back. I was running low on money and--"
The Baali pats his guitar case with some affection, "--I thought I'd go and make some gas money. You know I had to sell my old car and get this van, right?"
Markham nods along and is about to ask another question when Burt interrupts, "I'm sorry to hear that. How have you been?"
Markham shuffles on the spot, "Good, I guess. I've been...doing good."
"Embrace anyone yet?"
"No."
"Haha. You'll get there...eventually. Just make sure that whoever you Embrace isn't a total monster, or an asshole, heh. I'd hate for my Childe's Childe to be a piece of shit."
He pauses and looks at Diego's pickup truck, "What about that dude? Is he...y'know, is he a part of a Coterie or whatever they call it around these parts?"
"He is. It's a long story, Burt."
Burt nods and smiles, "Hmm, it always is, Markham. It always is. How long we talking here?"
Before Markham can answer, Burt calls out to Diego, "HEY, BUDDY! You got any places to be??"
Diego peeks out and hollers back, "NAH! Take your time, hermano!"
Burt faintly chuckles, "Wow, he seems nice. C'mon, let's go in the van and you can tell me all about it. You got that look on your face, rock star. You need...what, advice, help, whatever?"
"..."
Burt puts his arm around his Childe and leads him towards the van, "C'mon. Don't be shy. I know you've got a lot of questions and I'm happy to answer 'em all. But, you gotta talk to me. I'm no mind reader. I knew a few Malkavians who could do that shit, but I never felt right around them, haha."
"Fine."
Burt opens the backdoors of the van and sits on the edge. He pulls out his guitar, a dusty old acoustic thing, and begins strumming it. He asks Markham to join him.
Markham sits down next to his Sire and looks at him expectantly. He can't believe this is happening. What's Burt doing here in F-City? Why now?
Burt clears his throat and continues to strum on his guitar, a tranquil and almost soothing melody.
He starts off, "So, what's on that mind of yours, huh?"
"A lot."
(THAT is quite an understatement!)
Burt strums his guitar and sways from side to side, humming some tune that Markham recognizes parts of.
"I have a...few questions."
"Well, shoot. I got most of the night."
"What happened?"
Burt shrugs nonchalantly, "Now, that's a loaded question right there, kiddo. I'm 'fraid you're gonna have to be a bit more specific on that one...heh."
Markham gulps and reframes his query, "What happened...before...you Re-Embraced me?"
Burt stops playing and his eyes widen in shock, "Whoof! You don't mess around, do ya, rock star? Do you, do you really remember nothing from that night?"
Markham shakes his head, "Only flashes and fragments. Nothing...nothing that makes any sense. It's all jumbled up. I--I was hoping you could shed some light on it."
Burt sighs, "Well, are you ready to go through all of it again? Maybe there's a reason--"
Markham frowns, "It's...I have to know. I...wanna remember. I can't keep going on like this."
Burt puts his guitar aside and places his hand around his Childe's shoulder, "Alright, kiddo. You absolutely sure about this?"
"Yes."
Burt chuckles, "That's what you always said. Hm, where to begin..."
He thinks for a moment and says, "You were a Sabbat Shovelhead...Clan Lasombra."
A "Shovelhead" is a disposable Kindred who has undergone a particular form of Mass Embrace employed by the Sabbat for their War Parties. Back in the 1970s, almost as a prelude to the Satanic Panic, the Sabbat were conducting their own crusade against any and all so-called "Infernalists".
Burt was 1 of the Sabbat's targets.
Markham was on his way back from laying flowers at his sister's grave when an unmarked van pulled up out of nowhere, its tires screeching against the asphalt. 2 masked figures grabbed him and many others nearby and took them to an abandoned warehouse where dozens of other people were also taken.
They were all bound and gagged and their eyes were covered with blindfolds. Screams and cries of panic filled the tight space.
1 after the other, they were hastily and violently Embraced. Many didn't survive this process due to the shock alone. Before the remaining could awaken and Frenzy, a man in a thick, green ski mask went around and started whacking them over the head with a shovel.
The next thing Markham remembers is being shoved out of the same van, the area around nothing but dry and empty grassland.
There's a makeshift stage where Burt shreds and riffs on his guitar as many Frenzied vampires, barely Fledglings, rush towards him, screeching and howling.
Markham's newly-awakened Beast roars within him. He lurches forward and attacks the nearest vampire he can find. His claws and fangs extend and he mauls the other Frenzying vampire.
The young vampire is in so much pain, he doesn't even fight back. He simply lays there and weeps, tears of blood flowing down what remains of his face.
Markham, nearly losing it follows the other Shovelheads towards Burt. The rock star keeps on wildly playing and strumming his guitar as if it was a normal concert, the approaching vampires being his audience.
Markham catches himself and witnesses a few others tumbling into a speaker system and getting electrocuted violently, smoke and sparks coming off of them.
Burt laughs maniacally, "Hahaha! YEEAAAH! C'mon! C'mon!"
He grabs his microphone stand and starts swinging it about, whacking any Kindred that gets too close to him. Markham stands there, blood dripping down his chin. He stares in awe. He twitches and lunges towards a nearby Shovelhead.
He pins her to the ground slashes at her face with his claws. She screams and spits blood. He sinks his teeth into her neck and rips it open. He drinks deeply from her as she weakly struggles, her arms flailing about.
He feels the Vitae draining out of her and into him. A sick feeling builds up inside of him.
Burt keeps playing like the absolutely wild (and cool) Demon that he is. His hair flies about as he goes back and forth across the stage. He even jumps off of the stage and into the crowd.
Some of the barely-Fledglings are tearing each other apart while others are trying to get to him. He whacks a few with his guitar or casually dodges them and grins as they aimlessly run off into the distance, never to be seen again.
In the middle of the bloodshed, Burt places his foot on someone's body and maniacally riffs and shreds away on his guitar. The crowd swarms him, their voices animalistic and filled with nothing but base instincts and pure savagery.
A few seconds later, Burt kicks a few off, smacks some with his guitar, or dodges and hurls them straight into the shoddy electrical set up. He looks up at the dark sky and roars wildly, his amber eyes turning red. His fangs extend and his claws grow and his hair becomes a mess.
Burt utilizes his own twisted version of the Presence Discipline and drew the Frenzying Wights towards him like a beacon. Another van spews forth another wave of Frenzying and newly-Embraced Kindred.
They either swarm Burt or run off into the nearby woods. Burt continues to play and play, a wicked smile on his face. He shreds his banged-up musical instrument and howls a few screeches, rivaling the gurgled screeches of the horde approaching him.
Markham, holding on to something resembling sanity, looks around the carnage. He hobbles towards Burt and swipes his claws, but the latter deftly dodges to the side, chuckles, and continues to play.
Burt unleashes an earth-shattering scream, causing all of his attackers (Markham included) to go absolutely nuts. They stumble about, disoriented and confused. Markham collapses and tries to stand back up. His vision is blurry and his balance is off. He stumbles and trips, falling face-first onto the ground.
"AAAAAH! RAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!" Burt engages in some vicious headbanging and keeps on playing his defective guitar, stained with blood and brain matter.
A few minutes pass and the Shovelheads scatter. They were either destroyed by the other Frenzying vampires or cooked by the sun. The Sabbat didn't want any loose ends, so they made a quick retreat. A few of the surviving Shovelheads ran off, never to be seen again.
As far as Sabbat War Parties go, this was an abject failure- throwing bodies at the problem would only work if the problem wasn't a wild and untamed bisexual rock star who played with the powers of darkness at his fingertips.
Markham is left there, lying down on the ground. Blood and other fluids are splattered all over him. He's shaking, spasming, and twitching, his mind still struggling to make sense of all this.
Burt crouches down and runs his cold hand across the man's arm. Amidst all the guts, gore, and carnage, a look of sympathy washes over the rock star's face.
He shakes his head, "Who--who are you?"
Markham gurgles and groans. Burt's hand goes down and grabs the man's hand. He squeezes it and gives him a meaningful look, "I'm sorry you got dragged into this. It's not your fight, hmm?"
Burt grunts and pulls the man up. He feels some dark and infernal voice goading him to Embrace this man rather than just leave him there. His Blood sings and he feels like his very soul is burning.
Burt pulls Markham closer and bites into his neck, thus initiating the Re-Embrace, and more importantly, saving Markham Reed and giving him another chance at things.
Were it not for the ability of the Baali to Re-Embrace Kindred, Markham Reed would've been a goner back in the 1970s.
Burt exhales sharply and concludes by saying, "And there you have it, kiddo. Your uhm...origin story, I guess." There's a slight look of uneasiness on Burt's face, but it's quite concealed. It's as if he's recalling a bad memory, which it absolutely is.
Markham stares at the ground in deep silence. He doesn't speak for a few moments, the words of his Sire unveiling memories that were long shrouded and buried in the deep recesses of his mind. He feels his Beast stirring within him.
But, there's also something else stirring and clawing within him.
Burt takes a long sip from a flask. He offers it to his Childe. Markham refuses. Burt takes a deep breath and exhales.
Markham eventually speaks up, "So...that's how it went down, huh?"
"Mm-hmm."
"Are you sure?"
"I have literally no reason or incentive to lie to my own Childe. You think I wanted to hurt all those people those Lasombra assholes sent after me? You think I like doing shit like that? I...I had no other choice, I was simply defending myself."
Markham sighs deeply, eyes still transfixed on the ground, "We both did things that we're not exactly proud of on that night. But, why me? Were--weren't there others you could've pulled from the brink?"
Burt nods, "Yeah, yeah, there might've a few others now that I think of it, but I dunno, Markham. They weren't you. Something inside told me to choose you, to pull YOU from the brink."
"What was it? What did you see in me?"
"I saw a man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time, forcefully conscripted into some kind of a goddamn score-settling game masquerading as a fucking holy war."
Markham's eyes narrow and he glares at Burt, his voice trembling, the words failing to exit his mouth.
"Something wrong, Markham?" Burt looks at him with a concerned look. He looks...genuine. He looks hurt. He looks sad. His eyes are full of sorrow and regret.
Markham shakes his head, "No. I guess I owe you. I just...can't believe I forgot, y'know. I remember everything else- our chats, your lessons, and the rest of it, but that night is...it was a total blank." He pauses and adds, "Sorry."
Burt smiles weakly, "It's OK, rock star. It happens. We've all had some pretty messed-up nights." He leans back against the van, a distant look on his face.
The Baali puts his hands together and asks, "So, is there anything else that I can help you with???"
Markham gulps deeply and weakly nods, "I'm working a case..."
With that, Mr. Reed brings his Sire up-to-date on the events of the past few nights and how it relates to his investigation into LDJ and Paul Cho.
By the end of it all, Burt's eyebrows shoot up sky-high. He whistles and says, "Wow, wow, wow. That's uh...wow. I uh...whoa. Assassins, rich kids, whoa, you've got yourself mixed up in some crazy stuff, and here I thought my Unlife was a rocky road, heh."
"Yeah." Markham is still processing everything that's happened. This night has already been quite a lot.
Burt nods along, "Hmm. I've heard of this stuff going around, but not in the way you describe. Murder-for-hire is a sick and twisted business, but I never thought they'd stoop so low and start charging to bump kids off. Jesus."
"Hm. This...this isn't the America I remember, Burt."
Burt chuckles and faintly scoffs at that, "Well, it is the America we're in right now. Goddamn, I'm sure of 1 thing- this isn't the America, the Union, I fought for. Even I struggle to recognize it sometimes, y'know."
(Burt was a Union soldier during the American Civil War, so he knows what he's talking about).
He does a wide, sweeping gesture and adds, "Lincoln's doing fucking cartwheels in his grave, that much is for sure."
Markham chuckles weakly and nods along. He feels tired. So, so tired. He's had a lot on his mind lately and this little reunion may have helped put certain things at ease, but other (more pressing) queries and matters linger.
"So, uh, yeah, that's the gist of it, Burt," Markham's voice is weak and tired. He feels exhausted and drained, physically and emotionally.
Burt pats his Childe on the back and says, "Hey, hey. Don't worry, kiddo. I'll help you out however I can. This whole thing sounds like a real shit-show, huh? Well, at least that Gangrel and his girlfriend give you a place to stay, good on them."
"Yeah, they're good people, Burt."
"I'm sure they are. Question is: are you good to them in return?"
"I try not to impose or take advantage. Diego does insist on dropping me off, sticking around, and picking me up. I guess that's just his way of helping, y'know."
"Good, good. Y'know, sometimes I can no longer recognize this country. Sometimes, it...it almost feels like we fought for nothing, y'know. Bled and died just--"
Markham tries to reassure his Sire, "But it wasn't all for nothing. Slavery in this country came to an end because of what you and the others did."
Burt scoffs and waves dismissively, "Yeah, well, that's true. But, the way things are going now...it feels like our struggle was in vain and for naught. We should've wiped every last one of those slave-owning assholes of the map- scorched fucking earth."
"..."
The rock star heaves a sigh, "Ah, we didn't know that the Confederates were gonna rebrand and take over, heh. The Republicans would go on to become antithetical to Lincoln and the Democrats would just sit, thumbs far up their asses, and help fascism come in without so much as a fight. Grrr!"
"Yeah. I...I'm not sure it's that bad, Burt." Markham is still trying to process all this. He's had a lot on his mind and he's been distracted by the case and all.
Burt presses his lips into a thin line and regards his Childe for a moment, "Yeah, well, you haven't been paying attention, then. Also, lemme remind you: don't let anyone ever give you that crap talk about 'states' rights'."
He leans closer and emphatically states, "I was there, kiddo. Alongside my brothers and sisters, I lived through and fought against that fucking inhuman and barbaric institution of slavery and everything it stands for. I will NOT let those sacrifices be in vain."
The determination and passion is apparent in his tone.
"Yeah," Markham nods along in agreement.
Markham then says, "You uh...got fans in this city, Burt. Fans of your old music."
Burt looks at his Childe incredulously, "What?! Really?! From what I've seen, this city doesn't seem to give 2 flying shits about music- not a good sign in my books. But, I'd love to meet these fans..."
"He was selling bootleg copies of 1 of your albums."
Burt chuckles loudly, "Oh, hahahahahaha! I really don't mind that! As long as someone's ears are being touched by my music, then I'm happy."
"You uh...wanna meet him?"
Burt shrugs a shoulder, "Sure, why not?"
Before Markham can tell his Sire about this super-fan, he asks an important question, "Did you present yourself to the Prince yet?"
This query elicits a wild and raucous laugh from the Baali rock star, "Hahahahahaha! Nah, nah. I'm not planning on doing that shit anytime soon; I don't play by the Camarilla's medieval niceties- I'm a punk rocker, a rebel. You know that, don't you?"
"Hmm. Yeah. Did you um...join that organization, or whatever, you were always talking about back then? The um--"
Burt interjects, "The Inconnu? You remembered that, huh? Nah, I'm still looking for my 'in'. That's why I'm on the road. I'm after these guys that have a...dagger box in their possession."
"A dagger box?"
"Yeah, it's uh...a long story. Let's just say...that it'll help make certain unpleasant things easier. I need it and the guys who have it."
"Who are they??"
"Well, I'd like to keep that private, rock star. Besides, you already got A LOT on that mind of yours. So uh...I hope you found some closure with what I've told you."
Markham nods and thanks his Sire, "Yeah, I feel relieved, if only a little. It's still a lot to take in and process after all these years, but, yeah."
"You're welcome, kiddo. You're welcome. If there's anything else I can do for you, hm?"
Markham looks at his Sire expectantly, "Can you gimme any more advice?"
Burt winces and clicks his tongue, "I...I'm really no good with financial stuff. That was always your domain and area of expertise. I remember 1 time, I had a groupie do my taxes, haha! Ah, anyway, best I could tell ya is this: survive."
Markham's eyebrows shoot up and he turns his head aside, "Hm. Yeah. So, before I became Baali, I was Lasombra, huh? That would...explain my distaste for that particular Clan. Uh, Burt?"
"Hmm?"
"Is...is there still any Lasombra left in me?"
Burt confidently answers, "Nope, none at all. I'm sure of that. Why, do you...feel any different? Do you feel meaner or colder or do you look all funny and weird in front of mirrors??"
"I don't know. No, no, and definitely not."
Burt gently claps his Childe's back, "Then, it's safe to conclude that there's no Lasombra in ya, heh. Don't worry. Remember the Riddle?"
Markham repeats it from memory, "A Beast I am, lest a Beast I become."
Burt remarks, "It's paradoxical, sure, but it's a good way to stay human, I guess. The Beast is the dark and animalistic side of us, the primal urges and instincts that guide us in our eternal Hunger for blood."
He gesticulates and adds, "We Kindred, are born of and from darkness, so there will always be a connection and kinship there. But, we can't let the Beast define us or control us. Otherwise, we're just wild animals with fancy powers...like the Garou."
"Hm. That sounds right. Listen, I should really get going."
Burt smiles a tight smile and nods, "Mm-hmm. I'm gonna hang back here and play for an audience of crickets and flies and dry ground. It's like some people here don't even know what...culture is."
Markham gets up and queries, "What do you mean by that?"
Burt clicks his tongue, "I was playing in this really fancy-looking bar with purple lights and booze more expensive than my ride. I decided to give 'em some Pink Floyd, but literally nobody there knew or cared about any of it. They kept asking for something else entirely, ugh. It was a total nightmare."
"I'm sorry to hear that."
"Ah, it's alright. You can't please everyone all the time. It's their loss, not mine. I'm still gonna go out there and play whatever for whoever's even bothered to care."
Markham nods and walks towards Diego's pickup truck. Diego looks at the Baali climbing in and asks, "All done with the reunion, homes?"
Markham puts on his seatbelt, "Mm-hmm."
The Gangrel nods over to Burt and points out, "Hey, you know, your Sire's got that Iggy Pop look about him, heh."
Markham turns over to his Sire and looks him over, eyes squinted, "Yeah, yeah. I...guess he does."
Before Diego can start his vehicle up, Burt approaches and leans on the window frame on the passenger side.
He grins and asks, "Say, we should probably keep in touch, right? I don't plan on staying in this place for too long, but..."
Markham looks at the Feral and asks, "Is it OK if I give him your address?"
Diego looks unsure for a moment, but he quickly shrugs it off, "Yeah, yeah. He's not with the Baali from around here. Marisol will understand."
Burt's expression softens, "I'm sorry about your pets, man. Markham here told me all about what the Baali in this city are up to."
All it took was a few short sentences for Markham to essentially bring his Sire up-to-speed on what goes on with the Kindred of Flimont City.
Diego weakly smiles and responds, "It's not your fault, hermano. You don't have to apologize for it."
Burt pointedly tells the Feral, "You're a good man, Diego. It's guys like you that gimme hope for a better future down the line, y'know, that our sacrifices, that the blood we shed wasn't in vain and for nothing. Immigrants made this nation what it is. Without 'em, we'd have collapsed into oblivion decades ago."
The Outlander smiles at that, but that quickly fades away, "True, true. But, compliments from Gringos like you, no matter how well-meaning, don't exactly pay the bills, huh?"
Burt sighs, "Yeah, yeah. I getcha. Absolutely. Hey, Markham, take good care of this Gangrel and be nice, alright? He's giving you a place to rest, don't endanger him or get him caught up in anything crazy, alright?"
Markham nods and says, "Alright, Burt. Thanks...for everything. You've um...put my mind at ease."
Burt smirks, "You're my Childe, I'm your Sire. Even if you're a Neonate, it's still my duty and responsibility to make sure that you survive the nights. And remember: Survival's the game we all play."
Markham sighs deeply and bitterly replies, "Until we can no longer afford to do so." That's exactly what Roxanne told him when they last spoke and the topic of survival was brought up.
The Baali rock star presses his lips into a thin smile. He curtly nods and walks off to play some music for the dusty flora and fauna around here.
Diego starts the pickup truck and slowly drives off, the van disappearing from view. Markham heaves a sigh and closes his eyes. He throws his head back and lets the night air hit his face.
Diego looks over to his passenger and asks, "Everything OK, homes? You got this weird look on your face, heh."
"Just tired, that's all. It's been a long night."
The Gangrel sighs and concurs, "It certainly has, hasn't it? Back home, right? Unless you got any more places you wanna stop by?"
"No, I think I'm done for the night. And, thank you. You've...stayed with me this far. It...has to count for something, right?"
The Feral nods and accelerates his vehicle, the speed picking up, "Yeah, yeah. What are friends for, right? Besides, you were, and still ARE, a vato in distress. I see that and I gotta get in there and help in whatever way I can, man. It's just who I am, y'know."
"Yeah. Thank you. You and Marisol. You've both done a lot for me." The sincerity is real and apparent in Markham's tired voice.
Diego looks at Markham from the corner of his eye and inquires, "So, what's the whole deal with your Sire?"
"Burt? Well, it's long and it's complicated."
There's traffic up ahead. Diego wryly laughs and points out, "Well, shit. It looks like we have time."
Markham figures there's no use hiding his messy (and bloody) past from the man whose Haven he temporarily stays in. So, in the midst of this bumper-to-bumper traffic, Markham Reed tells Diego...everything.
Diego does look shocked and utterly flabbergasted at certain parts, his eyes widened in disbelief and horror in equal measures. He almost loses grip of the steering wheel a few times, his jaw agape.
"Holy shit," he simply says, "Holy fucking shit, man. You...you were a fucking Sabbat Shovelhead? HOLY SHIT! I heard stories about that stuff, whoa!"
Markham explains, "Well, hmm, yeah. Of all the Clans, I'd have to say that--that the Lasombra is probably the worst. I know I'm painting with too broad a stroke, but--"
Diego reassuringly says, "There's no Lasombra in F-City. Don't worry, homes. They won't ever be here. Not if WE Gangrel have anything to say about it."
Markham uneasily says, "I...hope so, Diego. I really do. I don't even wanna know what they'd do to an already beaten-down city like this."
(The very thought sends shivers up the Demon's undead spine).
The ride back is fairly long, but Markham is able to rest and relax and recharge a little. The conversation with his Sire has helped him put some things in perspective and he feels a bit more grounded and ready to face whatever comes next.
But, HOW ready he would be remains to be seen. A lot is about to happen, a lot is about to go down in the next couple of weeks. The question remains: will this middle-class Federal Government employee be able to hold on to his Humanity?
Only time will tell, and it has a lot it wants to tell us.
The next couple of nights will prove to be...trying for all involved. From Dr. Collins to Mauve Lilac to Markham Reed and everyone else, be they mortal or immortal (or somewhere in between), caught up in this dangerous game of power and deception.
There are still unseen forces, lurking in the shadows and waiting to pounce...or be pounced upon.
Somewhere else in this city...
Dr. Collins tells Wesley he's going for a quick drive somewhere. He tells the receptionist he's got some things to see to (can the good doctor be any less vague?)
The Tzimisce doctor also tells Wes not to worry. The kid still needs reassurances after what's happened.
Wesley nods and returns to carefully and diligently arranging patient cards in alphabetical order. Dr. Collins cracks a small smile upon seeing this. He then gets in his green Honda and drives to his intended destination.
He keeps his eyes on the road ahead and only stops when needed (like, at a red light). From the rearview mirror, he thinks he sees a familiar vehicle.
The Stoker shrugs it off, "Hm, just my imagination."
After a few minutes, Dr. Collins reaches a storage center near the outskirts of this city. He steps out of his vehicle, closes it, and heads to the unit he's been renting out for years now. He already has the key ready. The lock opens and he slides the doors open.
The ground below his feet is cracked and weeds grow out of it. The space smells musty and damp. But, the vampire pays little heed to these things. He switches on the lights and makes his way inside the storage unit. The lights flicker and cast an ominous glow around the tight space.
The Flesh-Shaper shuts the doors and takes a look around this space of his. It's about the size of a small room, or a small apartment. Inside, there are a few pieces of old furniture, trinkets, stacks of old magazines, and such.
Tzimisce, generally, like holding onto (one might be impelled to say "hoarding") stuff from their pasts (or mortal lives) or stuff that they simply find valuable and interesting. Some, like Dr. Collins, can let go of all that stuff, but others simply can't.
So, they settle for a compromise of sorts and keep them in places like this. This is just a small part of what Dr. Collins has accumulated over the decades.
It's also a good place to store extra stuff that there's simply no place for in the doc's Haven.
With money currently being tight (the recent expenses are certainly NOT helping), Dr. Collins looks around and contemplates selling some of this stuff. He strokes his chin and peers through his lowered glasses at a stack of old records he hasn't listened to in decades.
He figures he can sell a few. Maybe he'll get lucky and find a vinyl record collector or 2? But in this uncultured city, that's a big "if".
Dr. Collins shakes his head, "No, I'll...hold onto those a little while longer."
(That's the same exact thing he told himself back in 1986!)
The doc walks around and takes a mental inventory of the dust-caked stuff in here, "Hmm, MAD Magazines, old medical journals, a few of my old clothes and letters, ah, I see I still have that old typewriter of mine. I should show it to Wes, heh." He smiles fondly at this.
He's about to sit down on an old couch when he hears some strange noises and shuffling behind him. His Beast stirs within him. His skin crawls and his hair stands up on end. He feels cold all of a sudden.
His claws pop out and he slowly unlocks the door, ready to bolt (or attack) if need be. The sound is getting louder. His fangs extend and he licks his lips. His eyes dart about frantically as he reaches for the doorknobs.
He opens the door and squints his eyes, spotting no one. No one at all. He blinks in confusion, shakes his head, and closes the doors again. He locks them. He scratches his head and sits down on the couch.
After spending a minute in silence, the Stoker moves a false wall aside. This leads into a tight and cramped space. He pulls a sheet over a gurney and looks down in indifference at who's on it.
His expression hardens and he covers them back up. Without saying a word, he rearranges the false wall and makes sure it's all covered up. He heaves a sigh and checks his watch, "Hm, I'm...running late."
As Dr. Collins is about to head towards his car and drive back to the clinic, his undead hairs stand on end. He hears something strange again. He feels a sudden chill as if someone is watching him.
He hears a very faint noise. It sounds like scratching. Like...claws scraping against the surface of a hard, metallic surface.
The doc turns around and spots a shadowy figure in the distance. From where he's standing, he can't make out much...apart from the fact that they're human.
He narrows his eyes at this silhouette and gulps as he takes a few cautious steps towards them. Whoever they are, they remain standing in place, arms seemingly folded in front of them. He stops and tries to make out some more features.
The lights are dim and it's difficult to make anything out.
Dr. Collins clears his throat and asks, "Hello? C--Can I help you?"
The figure takes a step into the light. It's Sheriff Velma DuPont. She lifts her chin and stands there, looking all smug and confident. The good doctor's eyes widen in surprise.
His jaw drops and he stammers in shock, "Y--you, y--you're--" He pauses and tries to compose himself.
The Ventrue Sheriff remarks, "Oh, I do love it when they squirm." She approaches the doctor and gives him a once-over.
She's wearing a trench coat and platform shoes. She's got some shiny lip gloss and eyeshadow on. Her hair is neatly tied in her usual up-do style. There's a thin smile on her face as she continues to size up the Tzimisce in front of her.
Dr. Collins glowers at her, "Are you...following me?"
The Sheriff shrugs casually, "So, what if I am, hmm?"
Dr. Collins is about to clap back, but he catches his tongue lest he run afoul of the Sheriff of Flimont City. He's not just any Kindred now, he's a part of the Primogen Council, so he best watch his step and choose his words carefully.
He says nothing and folds his arms across his chest. He regards her with suspicion and distrust, eyes narrowed in deep annoyance. He looks around warily, trying to find any others who may be lurking nearby.
Sheriff Velma shakes her head, "Don't worry. I came alone."
"Why are you even following me??"
"Walk with me." It sounds more like a command than anything else.
The Ventrue Sheriff's platform shoes clop and clack and click on the ground as she heads off somewhere. Dr. Collins sighs and follows her closely.
On the way out, he spots a dude sitting on a lounge chair and playing something on his PS2 console. There's a cooler besides him and he looks really tired and worn out.
Long day at work, perhaps. Dr. Collins recognizes this individual as a patient of his, named Travis.
Travis looks to be in his 30s. He has a scruffy beard and is a little chubby. He has a random tattoo on his forearm. He's wearing a t-shirt and black cargo shorts. His hair is unkempt and messy, but not to an absurd extent.
Dr. Collins stops in his tracks and approaches his patient, "Travis??!"
Travis puts his PlayStation 2 controller aside and greets his doctor, "Hey, Doc Collins! What's up, my man?" He holds his hand up, expecting a high-five. The doc reluctantly complies.
Travis then inquires, "What's uh...what's up? You here to rent out a storage unit??"
The Tzimisce shakes his head, "No, I'm...I already have 1. I--are you living here, Travis?"
Travis sighs deeply and lowers his head, embarrassed and ashamed, "Yeeah. It's cheaper than an apartment, y'know. The housing situation here is...not so great, man." He laughs weakly and awkwardly scratches the back of his head.
The Doctor sharply exhales, "Hmm, yes. I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you made an appointment?"
"I'll try, doc. It's not easy, y'know. My back's absolutely killing me, man. A friend at the garage recommended some OxyContin, but I know you hate that shit with a passion, huh."
He laughs heartily and adds, "Sorry, I shouldn't joke about that, haha!"
Dr. Collins simply nods, "Come by anytime this week, Travis. We'll see what we can do about your back."
The mortal presents a thumbs-up, picks up his controller and goes back to his game. Sheriff Velma flashes him a quick and curt smile and continues walking on.
Once out of that mortal's hearing range, the Blue Blood remarks, "You really care about your patients, huh?"
"Of course I do. Why wouldn't I??"
"You know, there was this Setite that I knew a long time ago. Well, long is stretching it a bit."
"Oh, a Setite? I knew a few. They seem...decent enough. I could see myself getting along and working with them, should the opportunity arise."
"Hmm, we'll see about that. Anyway, his name was Rafael De La Cruz..."
"Sounds...interesting. What made this Rafael so special? Was he an Elder or something?" Dr. Collins is quite curious, but he keeps a careful eye on the Sheriff. This entire situation is strange, to say the least.
She's been following him for who knows how long? He needs to tread carefully and avoid making enemies. Moreover, Dr. Collins's position as Primogen for the Tzimisce Clan is dependent on him keeping certain...matters hidden from the Prince and the Sheriff.
(Like whoever's tucked away in his storage unit, for instance).
Sheriff Velma answers his query, "Oh, I wouldn't call him an Elder. By our standards, he wasn't...that old. He wasn't a Fledgling, either. He told me something. And, after all these years it's still stuck to me like glue."
"What was it?" Dr. Collins looks at her, intrigued and confused in equal measures.
The Sheriff says, "He said, 'Velma, my dear. Don't bother trying to change things- let it happen. Ride out the chaos to its inevitable destination.'"
Dr. Collins winces and twitches when he hears this. He disagrees by shaking his head, "That sounds absolutely terrible! Where did he even get such an idea from???"
The Sheriff's voice takes a slightly more amusing tone, "From experience, I suppose. He also told me there were 2 things that were the greatest mistakes in human history."
The doctor prompts her to continue, "Well?"
She smiles wryly and tells him, "The Enlightenment was the 1st. The 2nd thing was, believe it or not, giving women the right to vote."
Dr. Collins grimaces and retorts, "If it wasn't for The Enlightenment, we'd all be dead or bedridden before we even hit 30; and that's just 1 of the many positives that came from it. And seriously, how the hell is women's suffrage a...mistake??" The doc looks genuinely dumbfounded and speechless by what he just heard.
The Sheriff plainly shrugs and slows down her walking speed, "You know how the Ministry is, doctor. Hmm, enough about him. He was...interesting, mysterious, even."
"He sounds like an asshole."
The Ventrue faintly chuckles, "So, how are things, doc? Any news on Galeb yet? Any info on possible whereabouts? Any leads, any...thing? Prince Antonio is on my ass about this and I'd like to actually get somewhere for once."
Dr. Collins sighs in annoyance, "I wish people would stop asking me that question. He...never mind."
Sheriff Velma shakes her head, "Oh, no, please. Don't leave me hanging here. I'll follow up on anything."
"I don't know anything. Now, please, stop asking me about him. It's starting to get...a bit...annoying." For whatever reason, he looks a lot more agitated and twitchy now.
Sheriff Velma notices this and narrows her eyes at him, "Why the sudden change in demeanor, honey? All I did was ask a simple question."
"Well, I um...I don't know. Like I said, it's...it's getting tiring, you know," the Stoker shrugs. He's trying to sound as casual as possible, but he can't hide the nervousness and uneasiness in his voice.
Sheriff Velma comes closer to him and puts her hand on his tense shoulder, "IF there's something you're keeping from me, Dr. Collins--"
The Dragon swats her hand away and says through gritted teeth, "I'm not."
Sheriff Velma holds up her hands in mock surrender and takes a step back, "Easy, easy, easy."
She lifts her chin and sternly warns, "And don't you ever swat my hand away like that...ever again. Got it?"
Dr. Collins lowers his head a little, "I'm sorry. Forgive me. I'm just...under a lot of pressure right now. After Prince Antonio expected me to cough up 10 grand, money's been tight."
Sheriff Velma shrugs and carelessly waves her hand around, "Why don't you dive back into your storage unit and sell some stuff, then, hmm?"
The doc sighs deeply, "I was actually considering that."
"And?"
"And what? I...still feel kinda attached to that stuff. It's a Tzimisce thing, I guess."
"Hmm, I'm all too aware of how you Fiends love hoarding things...and people."
"It's just things for me."
The Ventrue Sheriff runs her fingers across a random door and taps on it a few times, "Funny thing is, we rent out a few of these babies every now and then. It was overflowing with the great unwashed homeless population a few nights back."
Dr. Collins gasps, "My god."
"Hmm, yes, so sad. Anyways, the Prince doesn't take too kindly to squatters on his properties, so they had to be...evicted."
"That's awful!"
"It is what it is, Dr. Collins. The game's rigged, best I can do is heed the advice of Rafael: shrug it all off, let what happens happen, and go along for the wild ride."
The Flesh-Shaper firmly disagrees with her assessment, "Not me. No. I can still do some good here, even if this city sucks."
The Sheriff looks him up and down and comments, "Is that why you're so devoted to your patients and that clinic of yours? Because you think you're doing good there?" She looks incredulous and amused at this.
Dr. Collins is quick to respond, "I KNOW I'm doing good there!"
"Well, I won't argue with you. Do you even know why I'm here?"
"To stalk me because you have nothing better to do?"
"Au contraire, mon cher (FR: my dear). I have plenty of better things to do tonight. Still, I'm obliged to run that thorough background check on you. After this, I might go and speak to your fellow Tzimisce. Dr. Sarah, perhaps?"
Dr. Collins calmly states, "Knock yourself out. She's a good friend of mine."
"I'm sure she is, darling. I'm sure she is. But, you Tzimisce seriously have a hoarding problem."
Dr. Collins lightly scoffs at her, "C'mon, it's not THAT bad. Maybe it's a way for some of us to keep in touch with our Humanity, have you ever thought about that, or is that something else you plan to dismiss while riding out to your 'inevitable destination'?"
Sheriff Velma clicks her tongue and dismissively waves a hand around, "Oh, hush, doctor. It's like you don't even know me. I know the struggles we all face. My job is making sure those struggles don't make the 9 o'clock news."
The Stoker counters, "A hoarder hardly sounds like a Masquerade breach, let alone prime time material. Besides, if anything, the media around should be focusing their efforts on other problems."
The Sheriff raises an eyebrow and prompts him to elaborate, "Such as??"
"Such as--do you even know what's going on around here??"
"If it intersects with Kindred matters, then it's my problem. If not, well...I don't really see the point, honestly. Why? Has something happened?"
Dr. Collins sighs in frustration and doesn't dignify her out of touch question. He changes the subject, "What do you want, Sheriff Velma?"
She takes him to a corner and lowers her voice a bit, "I actually had a medical question. A...personal medical question."
Dr. Collins straightens up, "Oh? I can help with that. Um...what's bothering you?"
The Blue Blood Sheriff explains, "In the DuPont family, there's a history of breast cancer. I just wanna double-check and make sure everything's alright with me."
Dr. Collins scratches his chin and thinks about how he can respond to this query, "Um, hmm, you'll need to give me some more details."
"From what I understand and from what other DuPont women have told me, it's pretty prevalent and tends to strike every generation. My mother had it when I was little. My grandmother had it, too. So did my aunt."
She takes a deep breath and continues, "So, do you think I'll be OK? I'm already over that age and still nothing."
The doctor nods and says, "It's hard to say, Sheriff Velma. The best I can tell you is to schedule an appointment and I'll run a few tests on you, send the results to the lab, and see what comes back. Well, that's normally what I'd do, but your...situation complicates things."
"How so?" She looks on edge and nervous. Even her dead eyes look somewhat fearful and alert.
Dr. Collins leans in and quietly tells her, "Well, everything, really."
She blinks a few times and stares at him blankly, "Huh?"
He explains, "It's complicated for someone without the necessary background. Best thing I could suggest is you perform a few breast self-exams in your free time."
"Oh? How--how does that work exactly?"
Dr. Collins patiently tells her, "Just know that most lumps and abnormalities aren’t cancer. When were you Embraced, anyway? Did you feel or notice anything different before or immediately after your Embrace?"
"I was Embraced in the 1940s. And, no, not really. I remember waking up and feeling like a whole new woman. I never had to worry about any of those pesky things mortals had to deal with. No colds, no periods, no flu, no measles, no polio, nothing. Heh."
"Yeah, if only it were that easy."
Dr. Collins proceeds to explain some simple breast self-exam techniques she can do from the comfort (and privacy) of her own Haven. He asks her to share her results with him so he can get a better idea of what he's dealing with.
He even goes as far as to tell her that there are various forms of breast cancer and that she should schedule an appointment with another clinic, "Don't worry, she's a Ghoul, so you don't have to be so concerned about any Masquerade breaches or whatever tends to get Sheriffs all agitated."
The Sheriff looks at him and says nothing, but her expression clearly speaks volumes. Regardless, she's impressed by his dedication and thoroughness when it comes to his patients' health and wellbeing.
She nods firmly, "Hmm, I'll keep that in mind. So, I just...strip naked and touch myself in front of the mirror, huh?"
"Breast self-exams are not exactly a foolproof replacement for more comprehensive options like mammograms, but I have no idea how those machines would react to our vampiric bodies, so this is the next best thing. Admittedly, I haven't done much studying on this particular issue. I should, though."
The Sheriff nods and says, "I'll see what I can do. Any other pointers or words of wisdom?"
The Tzimisce Primogen dryly states, "Please stop following me. I know what my responsibilities are."
Sheriff Velma smirks, "Heh. Speaking of, the Prince has called a meeting tomorrow night. We still haven't decided on a where, but it's not gonna be at Elysium. Not the greatest call, but he's the Prince and his word is final." There's a hint of annoyance and disapproval in her voice.
Dr. Collins blinks a few times and nods, "I'll keep that in mind and make sure I'm not doing anything else during that time."
The Ventrue Sheriff puts her hands in her trench coat pockets, "Alright, Dr. Collins, we're done here."
"We are. Goodnight, Sheriff Velma. Set an appointment sometime this week."
The Blue Blood twirls her fingers and elegantly sashays away. She gets in her sleek red Mustang convertible. It purrs to life and she speeds off somewhere else. Dr. Collins watches her go and heaves a HUGE sigh of relief.
He looks around and goes back to his storage unit. He unlocks it and goes as far as to check on in whoever's on that gurney. His expression is neutral and unreadable.
He covers them back up and goes to his vehicle. He starts it up and drives back to the clinic. Along the way, his thoughts drift hither and yon and thither.
The Stoker is walking on thin ice. If ANYONE were to discover his little secret behind that false wall, it's his head coming clean off his shoulders, no exceptions, no explanations, no nothing.
So, the question remains: how long will he be able to keep this charade going? And even more importantly, what if said secret gets out?
The doctor banishes such troubling thoughts from his mind, shakes his head, and puts his foot on the accelerator, running an orange light that turned red just as he got past.
Traffic isn't too bad tonight. The streets are practically empty, which is unusual for this congested city. There's a lot of construction work happening around town and some parts of the road have been blocked off due to "maintenance" and "repair".
Dr. Collins decides to let his Ghoul, Brock, in on the secret at the storage unit. At least confiding in someone close will alleviate the accumulating stress and anxiety.
As he continues driving down a quiet and dark road, the doctor makes a sharp right turn. His tires screech as his vehicle skids a little. He stops to gather his composure.
In the back of his mind, he keeps worrying that someone's gonna bust open his storage unit, go through it like a whirlwind, and reveal the terrible truth lying right behind it. He's so worried about it that he almost runs over a cat crossing the road.
"Dammit!" he says under his breath as he narrowly avoids it. The feline scampers off into the shadows, its tail sticking up high. It turns around and hisses at him before scurrying off.
"Hmph, yeah, I absolutely deserved that. Heh. I...just hope nobody else around here is too nosy. God, I should consider moving--no, forget it. It's safe where it is. It'll be OK. I just need to figure out my next step. Hmm, yeah, my next step."
"What comes next? How's it all gonna play out?" he drums his fingers on his steering wheel as he ruminates on his current predicament.
What comes next is gonna be...intriguing, to say the least!
Chapter 11: Y2K
The sun, that great and terrible star of heat and light, has begun its ascent, ushering in a new day for the denizens of this Midwestern metropolis. The summer heat is brutal and stinging.
Traffic begins to build up as mortals ready themselves for yet another (hot) day of work, school, court appointments, or whatever else they're occupied with. It's another busy day for them and they're already starting off on a bad note, it seems. The usual. The monotony. The drudgery.
Add to that a bunch of hopped-up cops; the FCPD makes the LAPD look like the Hare Krishna. The police continue to be out in full force, assault rifles, armored vans, and all. Some folks have already gotten arrested for simply making comments.
1 guy said something along the lines of, "The FCPD needs to relax and give us a break, y'know." They promptly put him in cuffs and threw him in a cop cruiser for whatever they could cook up.
A group of 14-year-olds were seen doing skateboarding tricks on the streets in the wee hours of the morning. Now, their parents and guardians are going through a byzantine process of bailing their children out of a jail cell. All they did was do what all other youngsters have always done. It's as simple as that.
But, apparently, in this city, that's now a criminal offense. It's crazy. Absolutely crazy.
The media hoopla continues to swirl around as news crews from nearby cities and states descend upon the area like carrion flies. The 2 slain officers are lionized and praised to the high fucking heavens while there's barely a squeak about the other 4 people who were brutally murdered.
The citizens of this city are being fed a misleading narrative of the events. Any other alternative is either discarded or willfully ignored. Questions regarding the 4 people are shrugged off by the well-heeled talking heads in the media.
Which only begs the question: Who were those 4 people who Clarence had brutally murdered by Mr. Strickland's soldier? What made those 4 people (3 men and 1 child) so utterly unimportant in the eyes of the powers that be?
Why do THEIR lives matter so little?
The 3 men all worked for Laurence's company- Lancaster-SYS.
Laurence is the founder and CEO. The 3 men were named Matteo (a server and database architect), Jake (a programmer), and Jeong (a technician).
Due to the unaffordable housing in this damn city, the 3 men were living together along with Jake's son, named Leo. He was 8-years-old.
The 3 men were apparently commissioned to build a complex piece of software for a private infrastructure project that requires a lot of server and computing power. They worked night and day tirelessly at their project and it was nearing completion.
They were fueled by nothing but caffeine pills and promises of large bonuses. All good and well until Matteo got curious and started probing deeper into the finer details of the project.
The clients (whoever they are) weren't very happy about this. They threatened to pull out until Laurence's dad got wind of this. Clarence immediately hired Mr. Strickland's people to...take care of the problem.
The results were self-evident. The aftermath, on the other hand, continues to unravel. In typical PR fashion, the company spokesperson has offered "thoughts and prayers" to the families of the 3 slain men and the poor kid.
Their families have already reached out to various media outlets to get a more balanced perspective of what exactly is happening here. They want answers. They want someone to be held accountable.
They demand an investigation (a proper one) into these killings.
But, it looks like that ain't gonna happen any time soon. This is Flimont City, after all. A city governed by greed and avarice, a game rigged to benefit a small sliver while screwing over the rest.
Moreover, the 3 employees threatened to go public after they discovered the true extent of what they were taking part in and working on. Matteo and the others tried to call Laurence, but it was too late, the hit had already been put out, the money had already been transferred.
Mr. Green had already found them and done the dirty deed, thus sealing their fates.
That was that. 3 innocent workers and 1 wean dead along with the 2 cops. 4 whole families were shattered in an instant. All in a single sunny afternoon.
So far, nobody has drawn the connection between where these 3 men worked and the circumstances surrounding their murders, so the media continues to focus its energies on the 2 slain officers.
The police chief keeps up his menacing (albeit shopworn) routine of threats and tough-guy warnings to the denizens of F-City. Through gritted teeth, he promises swift and merciless retaliation to the killer of his blue brethren. He keeps up this vile rhetoric every time he's asked to speak to the press.
It gets so egregious that the FCPD's PR and media department have to issue these tame-sounding, sugarcoated statements, lest they give the wrong impression and incur EVEN MORE wrath from the wider public.
The citizens of Flimont City are already quite fed up and agitated with this heavy-handed (and heavy-handedly policed) state of affairs, so the last thing anyone needs is some trigger-happy, itchy-finger, bigoted cop going ballistic on a bunch of innocent people.
Afternoon is particularly sweltering in Flimont City. It's like walking into a brick oven in the desert. The local news station warns its citizens to stay inside or stay out of the sun's rays if possible.
It's only by sheer luck (which will indubitably run out soon) that there aren't more heat-related deaths around here.
People have been fainting left, right, and center due to the overwhelming heat and humidity. Some people have even died from the heat and dehydration, but the news reports and news articles make no mention of this.
The airwaves are all clogged up with Officers Davis and Sanchez and every silly little thing they ever did or said. Minus all their...problematic doings and sayings, of course.
In time, that great ball of fiery fire begins its unceremonious descent. The heat doesn't abate much. The evening air is humid and stagnant, the winds are non-existent. It's awful. Just awful.
Truly awful.
As soon as the sun has set, the Kindred rise and ready themselves to face the night ahead. Markham springs up and blinks rapidly. He rubs his face a few times and groans, "Oh, another night." His Beast stirs within him.
Its eternal Hunger needs sating of the red and sticky kind.
Diego awakens and sees Marisol still as a corpse. He shakes her a few times and she springs up, fangs and claws out. Her eyes are wide and alert. She takes a few deep breaths and her body relaxes a little.
The Feral smiles and says, "WHOA! Easy, haha! It's alright, chica. I'm here. We're OK. We're all OK."
He leans forward and kisses her on the lips. She sighs deeply and melts into his embrace. She smiles and kisses him back. She holds him and closes her eyes, resting her head on his shoulder.
"Ready for work tonight?" he asks while playing with her messy hair.
Marisol grunts and groans, "What other purpose do I have, hmm?"
Diego clicks his tongue and encourages his girlfriend, "Hey, hey, c'mon now. What's up, huh? You've been looking real sour since you came back last night."
With tiredness lacing every word, the Outlander says, "It's...just work, D. I've--I've been through worse." Her eye twitches and a few droplets of blood drip down her face. Her hands shake a little.
Diego hugs her tightly and reassures her, "We're gonna be fine, alright? Just...do what you gotta do and don't attract too much attention to yourself, OK? We're survivors, we're Gangrel, remember?"
Marisol nods and weakly laughs, "Hmm, yes, I know what Clan we are, D."
Diego cups Marisol's icy cheeks in his cold hands and asks out of concern, "Was it someone at work? Did they say something? Are they asking about your immigration status or some shit like that??"
Marisol shakes her head and gulps, "No. There's talk, only talk so far, about downsizing."
Diego lets out a gasp, eyes widened in shock, "Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That's bad. That's real bad." He shakes his head and rubs his girlfriend's back.
Marisol continues, "Yes. Rumors are going around that they're gonna cut 5% to 10% of the workforce. No details or anything. They just...tell us to stay on our toes and update our resumes."
Marisol is pulled in for a tight and reassuring hug. Diego whispers in her ear, "Hey, I gotcha, girl. It'll be alright, we'll figure it out. You just go do what you gotta do. And if it doesn't work out, we'll find a solution together. OK?"
"OK. I'll let you know how it goes."
Diego kisses her forehead and tells her, "Go get 'em, tiger!"
After showering, Marisol gets ready. She wears a silk shirt, a pencil skirt, and some of her abuela's old jewelry. She ruffles her curly hair and puts some makeup on. She looks at herself in the mirror.
Her face is a little patchier than usual. Her eyes are duller. Her cheeks are sunken.
"Hmm, not bad," she mutters under her breath, "I can do this. I just have to...be ready. For the worst."
Diego puts on a baggy flannel shirt and some corduroy pants. He hears what's she's saying and responds, "Or the best! Look, if you do get let go, I'll have no problem looking for something more...stable, alright?"
Marisol smiles warmly, "That's...kind of you."
Diego smiles a thin smile back, "Kindness to each other is what keeps us going, heh."
Marisol checks herself 1 more time. She smooths out some wrinkles in her shirt and nods. She walks out with Diego in tow. Markham is already in the living room, sitting quietly on the sofa and not moving an inch.
Marisol nods over to the Baali and says, "So, I heard you ran into his Sire last night, huh?"
Diego nods. He told Marisol everything. Of course he did. They tell each other everything. No secrets. Nothing. Ever.
He says, "Yeah. That Iggy Pop looking guy was kinda...ehh...interesting, I guess. I really can't find the right word to describe him. Some things, you just have to see for yourself, haha!"
Markham sighs deeply, "Hm. Yeah." He shudders a little and runs his fingers across his face, "I...wasn't quite expecting that. Hey, Diego?"
"What's up, d-man?"
Markham stands up, "You mind if I make a few phone calls before we um...head out?"
The Feral plainly shrugs, "Go right ahead, homes. Go right ahead." He watches Markham walk to the kitchen. The Baali dials a number on his flip phone and patiently waits for whoever's on the other end to pick up.
After a few rings, a sort of hoarse female voice answers, "Hello. How may I help ya?"
"Darla. It's me," the Baali says in a very laid-back but polite manner.
The Nossie exclaims, "Markham! How the hell are you doing, huh?"
"I'm fine. How...uh...how are you doing?"
Darla shuffles some things on her desk and stifles a groan, "Yeah, I'm all good. So, what's up?"
"I need some information, Darla. I figured you're the person who might be able to help."
The Nosferatu lady nods and a pen-clicking sound can be heard in the background of the call, "Shoot."
Mr. Reed proceeds to tell her everything (which isn't very much) he's managed to learn about Mr. Strickland's organization of contract killers.
By the end of it all, the blue Nosferatu lady on the other end of the line is reeling, "Whoa. Wow. That...wow, OK. Shit. That's truly messed up, huh? Yeah, I'll make some calls, turn over a few stubborn rocks, and see what's there. I'll get back to you. Just keep your phone on, alright?"
"I'll try, Darla. Thank you. Thanks so much. Talk soon."
"Talk soon."
The Baali hangs up and sighs in relief. He sits on a rickety old chair in the kitchen and rests his chin on his palm. He taps his fingers against his cheek and sighs, "I...hmm, what time is it there, anyway?"
After a minute or so, he dials another number. This time, Jamie answers, but she sounds so groggy and tired, "Hello? Who...who's calling? I--I didn't forget anything, did I??"
Markham immediately replies, "It's Markham. Jamie, are you OK?"
Ms. Pollux blinks a few times and stammers, "Oh, uh, hmm, yes, yes, I'm fine, I'm fine. Hey, Markham. What--what's up?"
Markham furrows his brows and inquires, "Are you alright, Jamie? You don't sound so great."
Jamie sniffles a few times and makes a few goofy and guttural sounds, "Hrmhp. Grrrfgh. Yeah, yeah, totes fine. Ugh..."
Markham winces and grimaces as his Touchstone groans and whimpers in the background, "Oh, no, that's not good."
Jamie stifles a cough and replies, "I'm fine, Markham, I'm fine. Don't worry about me, heh."
The Baali shakes his head, "Are you sure, Jamie?"
"Hmph, yeah, I'm sure, dude. I just, oh, wait...I don't remember leaving my window open..." she trails off as she shuffles out of her bed and heads to the window.
She looks around for a few seconds and closes it, "Huh, yeah, this wasn't open before. I'm gonna, hmm, I'll get right on that, I guess."
Markham's expression softens, a look of concern forming on his pale face, "Be...be careful, Jamie."
Jamie faintly laughs and throws herself back on her bed, "Yeah...yeah. God, I fe--feel so dizzy."
"Did you go and eat something you shouldn't have? Again?"
"Naaaah. I remember having some cup noodles that was, like, a day past the expiry date. It wouldn't be my 1st time doing something like that, heh. No, I feel all..."
She pauses for a moment, feeling quite nauseous, "...all woozy and my neck, like, really hurts. I must've slept in a wrong position or something."
Markham looks REALLY concerned now, "Are you sure you're OK, Jamie?"
Jamie lazily waves her hand, "Yeah, yeah. So, how's the investigation into those 2 bozos going?"
Markham scratches his head and sighs, "It's going great. Even then, there's not much to go on, really. I need more evidence before we can make a move against them. It's been...frustrating, to say the least."
"That's unfortunate. Sorry to hear that."
"It is what it is. Anyway, take care, Jamie. Get plenty of rest."
Jamie snickers, "Will do, commander Reed! Haha! I miss you, Markham. Really, I do. The office is so...bland, so bleh, without you around."
Markham plainly says, "I'll try to wrap things up as soon as I can, Jamie. To be honest, I'm kinda tired of this place. Now that I've seen it firsthand, I...I can see why people avoid this city at all costs."
"Oh, yeah, heh. True, true. I've been keeping up with the news. It's so sad, what happened to those people there."
"Hm. It sure is. Hey, I should let you go now. Take care."
Jamie laughs weakly, "Heh, you, too. And hey, Markham? Come back safely, OK?" Her tone is hopefulness laced with desperation.
"I will. I promise. Stay safe out there."
As he's about to hang up, Jamie suddenly asks, "Wait, wait, wait! Um...did you, hmm, did you meet someone nice, someone pretty yet?"
Markham pauses for a few seconds and answers, "Uh...no."
Jamie pouts, "Aww. Did you at least wear that aloha shirt? Y--you remembered to pack it, right?"
"I did. It fits really nicely."
"Haha! I'm glad to hear that. If--if it's possible, ah...never mind. I--ugh, I feel so weak and tired."
The Baali tells her, "Get some rest, Jamie. You don't sound so great. Are you sure you're not sick?"
"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I--I'll talk to you later, OK? OK, Markham. Bye-bye. Love ya!" She hangs up before her co-worker can respond. He puts his phone back in his pocket, sighs deeply, and goes back to the living room.
He sits down, looking a lot more stressed and agitated now. He rubs his temples. A knock on the door is heard. Marisol narrows her eyes and goes to answer it.
"Ola, senorita." Burt's voice is as clear as ever.
Marisol sighs and regards him with some suspicion, "Yes?"
The Baali rock star is dressed in a torn jean jacket, a collared t-shirt, and ripped jeans. He's wearing an inverted cross necklace and...eyeliner, because that's just how cool he is.
Burt bows his head and takes Marisol's hand. He gently kisses it and says, "Please allow me to introduce myself properly. My name is Burt. Might I just add that you're looking...absolutely smashing tonight, my dear."
Marisol yanks her hand away, "OK. That's enough, t--thank you. What are you doing here?"
Burt chuckles and looks behind her. He nods towards Diego, "Hey! Is rock star over here?"
Diego grins and lets the Baali inside, "Yeah, he's here, alright."
Burt has his guitar case slung across his shoulder. He enters the room and nods at Markham, who nods back. The 2 Kindred look at each other for a brief moment.
Burt grins and breaks the silence, "What's the haps, huh?"
Markham answers, "Oh, nothing, really."
Burt sets his guitar down, sits on the sofa, and kicks his feet up on the coffee table, "Well, then, this is a sweet place you got here, Feral."
Marisol folds her arms and shoots Burt a disapproving look, "Please...take your feet off my table. Thank you." She sounds firm, but not rude, when she says this.
The Baali shrugs and obliges, "Of course, of course. My bad. Marisol, right? Beautiful name."
"Hmm, yes, I'm sure it is," she turns to Markham and Diego and says, "I'm off to work now. See you later. Diego, a word."
Diego eyebrows shoot up, "The queen of the castle wants a word, heh heh. Be right back, boys."
Marisol takes her boyfriend out of earshot and asks, "Another Baali? Look, I know he has nothing to do with the Baali already here, but..."
Diego nods in understanding, "I know, I know, alright. But, we can trust 'em, alright? So far, Markham's not done anything to piss us off. A good thing, right? I'm sure his Sire is just as...nice. And he's sooo cool! Did you see that eyeliner he's got on?! It's dope!"
"Yes. I have the same brand. Alright. I love you, D. Take care. I'll let you know how tonight goes. See you later."
She pulls Diego in for a quick kiss on the lips. After that, she grabs her helmet, scooter keys, purse, and jacket and exits her Haven. The door clicks shut and Diego returns to the living room.
Burt asks him, "So, what's the plan tonight, huh? I gotta say, this city ain't all it's cracked up to be."
"Same, homie. Same. Let's see, first, we should feed. Man, I feel my stomach rumbling. Then, we can hang out, play some jams, whatever. Sound good?"
Burt nods, "Sounds like a party to me. You sure your lady won't mind me being around? She looked a little...flustered."
Diego replies, "It's fine. She understands. It's just work problems, y'know how it is."
"I sure do, buddy. I sure do."
Markham speaks up, "The sooner we're done feeding, the better. Diego here knows all the good hunting spots."
The Gangrel grins and lifts his chin up, "Damn right I do! We just have to stay out of sight, alright? And no making any dead bodies, alright?" He looks at Burt when saying that last part.
Burt plainly agrees, "That would be best, yeah."
The 2 Demons and the Feral set off, ready to feed on a few unsuspecting mortals. After a few minutes, they're back, Beasts satiated. Burt throws his head back and makes a satisfied grunt.
Diego whistles and stretches his arms. Markham is a bit more composed. The Feral looks at the 2 Baali and says, "C'mon, let's rock! How about it?"
The Baali rock star nods and gets his guitar out. He begins playing and jamming out, the music filling the room. Diego bops his head, Markham remains still and in-place, and Burt plays a few notes by strumming his acoustic guitar.
The 3 Kindred seem to enjoy each other's company, but Markham's mind, as always, is elsewhere. Diego jams along with Burt for a few more minutes.
After that, Burt puts his guitar aside and gently clasps his hands together, "Soooo, what's up?"
Diego jokingly answers, "Stars, the ceiling, the fan, and the roof. Hahaha!"
Markham has a distant look on his face, many things swirling around in his head, "I have work to do."
Burt clicks his tongue and dismissively waves his head, "C'mon, I won't take up too much of your time, OK? I got a few late-night gigs I gotta play at, anyway. The money's piss, but I'll fuckin' take it all the same. You can't be too picky when you're a musician. And a Kindred one, at that. Heh."
He then gets serious, "So, uh...I remember you said there were fans of my music in this 'lovely' city. Care to elaborate on that a bit more?"
Markham nods, "Yes."
Burt motions for his Childe to go on, "Well, don't leave me hanging here, kiddo."
Markham explains, "His name's Farooq. I think. He's at a tech store near the hotel I was staying at...before the, y'know. He's got bootleg copies of your album on a shelf, if I remember correctly. I'm sorry, it's just been a long week, y'know?"
Burt's eyes widen and he gets visibly excited, "Farooq, you say? Yeah, I'll check him out. And here I was, losing hope in this city's cultural scene. Where did you say he's at, again?"
"Near the hotel I was staying at. It's called the...the uh..."
Diego offers, "The Sheriton Grand, yeah. Real fancy-ass place, heh."
Burt nods his head and makes a mental note of it, "Alright, alright. Cool. Anything else I should be made aware of?"
Markham simply says, "Watch out for Sheriff Velma. Seeing that you refuse to present yourself to the Prince, she might just put you down on sight. She knows who you are because I had to tell her."
Burt scoffs, "Pfft. Like hell she will. From what I've been told, the Power Mongers around here aren't exactly known for being very welcoming or cordial to outsiders."
Markham shrugs, "True. Just watch yourself out there, Burt. With the way things are going in this city right now, I--I dunno."
Burt concurs with a low grunt and strums his guitar, "Hmm."
Markham turns his head aside, his thoughts drifting towards Jamie. The more he thinks about it, the more it seems like a vampire fed from Jamie, hence her sudden weakness and tiredness. She sounded so drained, even. So very...drained.
(It ain't the expired cup noodles).
Markham doesn't like it one bit, but his Touchstone is far, far away from him right now. He abruptly gets up, excuses himself, and tries Jamie's number again.
This time it goes to voicemail, "You've reached the cellphone number of Jamie Pollux, the one and only, haha! Please leave a message AFTER the beeping beep bop boop and I'll get back to ya!"
Markham clears his throat, "Hey, it's me. You don't have to pick up. I just wanted to say...be careful, stay safe, um...check your windows and don't uh...yeah, don't loiter around too much at nights. I know you like doing that, but just try not to. Take care, bye."
He hangs up and puts his phone away. He takes a deep breath and shakes his head. He returns to the others. They're still talking and chatting and having a blast, it seems.
Burt wildly gesticulates and recalls the time he came upon a random Kindred who bought into the Y2K panic. A Tremere of all people. As a result, they stocked up on buckets of blood.
That particular Usurper had taken the idea from Evangelical swindlers and liars proclaiming the end of the world...and selling doomsday-prepper food buckets. Only, in the case of certain vampires during that confused time period, the slop was replaced by actual human blood.
"It's a miracle the Camarilla didn't get involved, or worse, the fuckin' Sabbat," Burt tells the 2 Kindred in front of him. Markham listens quietly while Diego laughs and grimaces simultaneously.
Burt shudders and groans, "Yeah, well, I happened upon this ranch. The Tremere there had folk from around town hooked up to machines, tubes were stuck in their arms, and blood was being sucked outta them. That's when I realized, shit, they lost their goddamn minds, man!"
Diego asks, "Did you do something to save 'em?"
Burt straightens up, "'Course I did! It was lunacy, nothing more than a change in dates. I never did buy into all that Gehenna end is nigh bullshit. Hell, I've heard the same crop of segregationist bozos harp on about it since the fucking 1950s! It was nuts during the 1980s, isn't that right, Markham."
Markham dryly concurs, his mind still on Jamie, "Hmm? What? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. The uh...whole end times craziness. Yeah, it's not exactly America's greatest hits, heh. But, the Tremere at that ranch, what happened to them?"
Burt sighs deeply, "I can't say for certain, kiddo. I managed to rescue a couple people and let the others go, but that's about as much as I could do, really. Shoved as many as I could in my jalopy and booked it to the next county over. The sun was about to come up, so I gave 'em the car and told 'em to keep driving."
Diego sighs, "Man, that sounds traumatizing. Sheesh. I hope they're doing OK now."
Burt strums his guitar a few times and slowly nods, "Me too, buddy. Me too."
The Baali rocker stares longingly into the distance and shakes his head, "I'm not one to get hung up on the past, even when you're as 'old' as me, haha. Either way, you're never too old to learn a thing or 2, hahaha."
The conversation eventually shifts to Burt's travels to South Central Los Angeles.
After reading a series of articles in a cyber café, written by an investigative journalist named Gary Stephen Webb for the San Jose Mercury News, he decided to go down there and see, for himself, a focal point of the crack epidemic and its impact.
"That was a year back," Burt vividly recalls, "Damn, they're still suffering down there. It's so...sad, really. I did my best to bring some comfort to these folk with my guitar, but you need a whole lot more than a stringed instrument to make a real difference. Ain't that right, Markham?"
The Baali is snapped out of his worried stupor, "Hm? Yes, I guess so. What were you saying?" He's so lost in thought. His Touchstone is the only thing he's currently thinking about.
Burt queries, "You read the 'Dark Alliance' series by Gary Webb, Markham? It's damn good journalism, not that sensationalized yellow tabloid shit."
"Oh, yes. I'm familiar with it. I'm also...skeptical of a lot its claims, if I'm being completely honest with you, Burt. To me, it just feels oversimplified and...a bit far-fetched and lacking." He says this while recalling the articles he read on his bulky work computer during some free time in the office.
Diego scratches the back of his head and takes Burt's side, "Well, I've...heard of it from some busters on the block. The CIA doing shit like that doesn't surprise me at all, hermano. The only surprise is why it took so long for us to learn about this."
Markham counters, "It's a lot more...complicated than that, Diego. I've read the series twice- I was bored- other outlets have pretty much refuted most of it, anyway. Reputed outlets like The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Washington Post. They wouldn't necessarily lie."
It would appear that some stories are too true to be told, even too true for the naïve Mr. Reed over here.
Markham presses his lips into thin line, "Agree to disagree?"
The Baali Neonate has still got some misplaced bliss; he's far too trusting of the system he's been working in and for. Some of that old middle class left-liberal idealism still sticks to him.
Sure, he's thorough, careful, and diligent in his work at the SEC
