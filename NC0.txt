Story 1: Tits, Tits, Tits
Note: One of the first things I ever wrote! First-Person POV.
We go into the bedroom, lock the door, and take off our clothes. I undid her bra and let her breasts breathe. I step out of my panties and leave them on the floor.
I started sucking those tits! 1, 2, 3! The girl has a really nice pair! Then we are naked. Her body is nice and curvy. She's just wearing a G-string bra that doesn't even cover half of her tits.
Maybe that's why she likes to show them off so much? Anyway, she gets on top of me and starts riding me. "Oh God! You're so good!" she moans as I keep sucking those sweet tits.
She starts bucking up and down and pushing her tits against my face, trying to get more tongue action. It's great! Then she asks if I can lick her pussy. Her up there and me lying back on the bed.
What do you think?
Of course, I say yes! So I laid down waited for her. She straddles my hips with her legs and puts her crotch in my face. This time it's pussy licking instead of boob licking. But, hey, I ain't complaining!
I don't know how long we went at it like this. We must have been pretty loud because I swear I heard someone knocking on the door. They must not be aware that we are having sex right now!
Finally, though, I feel myself getting close to an orgasm and tell her to keep at it. And she does! Thank you!
Now it's my turn again. So I sit up and tell her to get ready for some serious pleasure. Well, it wasn't anything like I expected. But this time she fingers me and sucks my tits simultaneously! That was incredible!
She did it all while moving her pelvis around in circular motions. My goodness!
She started moaning and panting. I looked at her and said, "Do you think your roommate heard us?"
The girl replied with a seductive smile and then told me, "Yeah! I'm pretty sure she heard something."
Afterwards, we laid close next to each other for a few minutes, and I put my head on those beautiful tits (I just couldn't get enough of them). We talked a bit about ourselves in the middle of some light kissing.
Apparently, she lives here alone too and goes to college nearby. She studies business administration and doesn't plan on leaving soon. Which means we'll probably see each other around sometime!
I hope so!
As we were lying there, I thought about all the fun we had today and decided to give her a goodnight kiss. She didn't protest at all and even wrapped her arms around me. I think we might have something special after all.
She asked me to stay over since she knew I was late and I could sleep in tomorrow. Sure, I said. I gave her a big kiss (a tongue kiss, of course) and fell asleep in those sweet, soft tits of hers! Ahh... bliss!
On Friday morning, I wake up with the sun shining through the window onto her tits. "Awww, it's so cute," I said. I saw her in all her beauty. What a sight.
I drifted back to sleep for a few minutes, but I was woken up by a kiss on the forehead. "Wake up, sleepyhead!" she said, giggling. She placed my head on her tits (again) and held me closer and tighter.
Later she started kissing my neck. Wow! Now I know what a real wake-up call feels like!
I gave her one last nipple-suck before we finally got dressed. She walked me out of her room and showed me to the elevator. We kissed goodbye and promised to meet again soon. She asked if we could spend some time together another day.
I nodded in the affirmative and gave her another huge kiss! I am going to miss those awesome tits!
"Bye!" she called from the hallway and smiled as she watched me walk away.
It was an amazing time. A tit-tastic time! We were more than friends; we were breast-friends! Breast buddies! If there's ever another opportunity for a second date, I will take it!
Anyway, that's all for now. Goodbye!
Story 2: The Erotic Adventure of Sarah Gold and Evelyn Meyers
Note: Breastfeeding somewhere in the ruins. Very amateurish writing due to the fact I was still a newbie at this whole thing at the time.
2 brave women, Sarah and Eve, embark on an epic journey into the depths of the jungle. Armed with nothing but their curiosity and determination, they set out to explore the unknown and uncover its secrets.
Along the way, they face dangerous obstacles and face their fears, as they fight to survive the harsh conditions of the jungle.
Join them on their journey as they explore the mysteries of the unknown and discover the the blossoming romance that has been waiting for them all along.
Sarah scribbles a few words on her diary: "When I awoke the next morning, my head was throbbing from the previous day's events. My body ached from sleeping in a tent all night and every muscle in my body was tense. The sun was rising over the horizon and I could see that it would be another hot day. A few drops of rain fell outside my tent, which made me groan at the thought of having to endure yet another humid day in the jungle."
She continues jotting: "I dressed quickly and exited my tent. There were many trees around us and I saw a small stream nearby so I decided to walk there for some fresh water. It had rained during the night, making everything wet, but the ground was still damp from the previous day's rain. As I walked through the woods, I heard something rustling behind me and I suddenly felt scared."
She stops for a moment before continuing: "Before I knew what was happening, a large, gray-brown creature jumped onto my back. The claws dug into my skin and it hissed loudly in my ear. I screamed as loud as I could and tried to stand up, but I couldn't move. It was too heavy and strong."
Sarah struggled and fought, trying to push the beast off of her, but it held fast. Suddenly, Eve emerged from her tent, machete in hand and charged the beast. She swung the blade down hard across its neck, severing its spine.
The beast fell dead to the ground and Eve asked Sarah if she was OK. Sarah sat there stunned by what just happened.
Eve said, "Sarah, hey, look at me, you OK?"
"Yes," Sarah replied in between her shivering. "Th--Thank god you came when you did." She looked down at the beast and noticed something strange about it. Its fur wasn't like any animal she had ever seen before; it was thick and black, almost resembling a tiger.
"Ocelot," Eve said, soudning very professional and knowledgeable.
"What is an ocelot?"
"They are very rare creatures found only in South America. They are also known as the smallest species of cougar. Very aggressive and territorial animals; they can grow to be 5 feet long and weigh up to 100 pounds."
"Wow! That thing was huge!"
"It was," Eve said matter-of-factly. "Now, we should get moving. We have just enough food for the day and then we'll be ready to make camp again tonight."
"Yep, lemme catch my breath." Sarah said.
As Eve was turning around, Sarah couldn't help but take a look at Eve's breasts. Her cleavage showing even though she wore a thin shirt. Eve saw her staring at her chest and smiled.
Eve moues, "You're not going to stare at my breasts all day are you?"
Sarah blushed and apologized. Eve blushed a bit as well.
They packed their things and continued walking until they got to the stream. Sarah filled her canteen at the river and drank some water. While she was drinking, she looked around and noticed that everything was covered in leaves and vines.
"Beautiful, isn't it?" Eve asked.
"Yes, it is."
"Wait here while I grab some fresh berries."
Sarah just couldn't help it, she caught another look, this time at Eve's long legs and amazing physique. Wow, she really was curvy.
Eve returned with a hand full of fruit and Sarah thanked her. She took a berry and chewed it slowly as she watched Eve eat hers.
"What you lookin' at?" Eve naughtily asked.
"Just admiring your beauty and um...the way it uh...complements the well, you know...uh...surrounding beauty."
Eve laughed out loud and said, "You aren't the first one to say that, love."
Sarah smiled, "Oh, you have no idea how...um, beautiful you are."
Eve cheekily replied, "I could say the same thing to you."
"No offense or anything," Sarah said, "but I've never met anyone quite like you. You are so strong and yet sweet. And you saved me from that thing back there. I owe you. Really, I do."
"Well, thank you. It's all part of the job."
"OK, Eve."
They both sat there smiling and almost making eye contact. Suddenly, Eve became quiet and seemed deep in thought. She stood up and walked away. Sarah followed her and asked, "Are you OK? Did I say something wrong?"
"No, Sarah. Everything is fine. Let's go."
The 2 kept walking and talking about random subjects until they finally arrived at the campsite. By then, night was rapidly approaching.
Sarah was just emerging from the bushes and that's when Eve saw her, beautiful, blonde, wet, and partially naked. She froze in place and stared. Sarah turned and saw Eve staring at her.
"Eve, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to surprise you. I just went for a quick dip and I must have startled you."
"Sarah, you don't need to apologize. I think you're gorgeous."
"Really?"
"Yes. Your body is amazing and your skin glows. It's so smooth and soft looking. And those big, blue eyes of yours are captivating."
Sarah was a bit flushed, yet she managed to say, "Thank you."
Eve smiled and asked, "I guess you're not used to being complimented?"
"Uh, Not really. Not much. At least, you know, not in a non-creepy way."
"Well, I'm glad you're getting used to it because you deserve it. Now let's get dinner started."
Sarah and Eve began preparing their meal. Eve cut up some vegetables and Sarah cooked them on the fire. Carrots and beans were tonight's fine delicacies (if one could call them that) and Sarah cooked them to perfection. Dinner was served and both explorers ate with great gusto.
Afterward, they washed up and lay down to sleep. As they were talking, Sarah once again looked down at Eve's boobs and noticed that her nipples were poking out of her thin shirt. They were slightly pink and pointing straight towards Sarah. She couldn't believe that she hadn't noticed them earlier.
"See something you like?" Eve asked in a teasing, almost flirtatious tone.
Sarah blushed and said, "No! I uh...it's just that, I haven't uh...never mind."
"Go on?" Eve said, giggling. "Well, I've spent most of my life in the jungle and I've seen my fair share of tits. I know what I'm talkin' about."
Sarah was shocked at Eve's boldness and found herself blushing again.
"What's wrong?" Eve asked.
"Nothing, I just, um--I think we should call it a night. Long day ahead of us tomorrow," Sarah nervously said.
"Heh, sure. Goodnight, Sarah," Eve said, still grinning.
Sarah went into her tent, still flushed, rolled over and closed her eyes. But she couldn't stop thinking about Eve and her beautiful, bouncy tits. She imagined what sucking on them would feel like and she felt her own nipple hardening. Then, she realized that her pussy was getting as wet as her surroundings.
She felt different. She had never thought much of this before and she was totally lost. She didn't even understand what was happening to her. All she was thinking about was about how Eve's tits would feel in her mouth.
She laid there for a moment, trying to calm her racing heart and her erratic breathing. She was so confused. She was so attracted to Eve and she wanted to touch her, kiss her, lick her, cuddle up with her. She wanted to make love to her.
She was so horny and she needed to come badly. But Sarah couldn't figure out why. It all seemed so new, weird, wonderful, and out of her control (for now, at least).
She was about to drift off when she heard Eve moving around outside her tent. Her eyes shot open and she sat up straight. Eve screamed.
"Eve!" Sarah cried, as she scrambled out of her tent. "EVE! WHAT HAPPENED! EVE! YOU OK?"
"Argh!" Eve answered, "it's...I'm not...Sarah, it's--something bit me. Something small and white, I've never seen anything like it before! Where did it go? Argh, damnit! Help!"
Sarah ran towards her friend and saw a small prick on Eve's shoulder- a bug bite or something. Sarah grabbed some twigs and rubbed them on the wound; however, the sting persisted.
"Stop touching it! Let me try something else," Sarah frantically said.
She went into the woods and quickly found some herbs and berries. She collected some and returned to Eve, who was lying on her side, still dazed from the bug bite or whatever that was.
Sarah bent down and placed one of the herbs over the sore spot and covered it with a piece of fabric. Even then, Sarah couldn't resist looking at Eve's cleavage. She noticed that Eve's breasts had swelled up a bit.
"Is this better?" Sarah asked, a look of concern washing over her sweaty face.
"Yes," Eve said, "T--Thank you, Sarah."
Sarah sternly asked her friend, "What the hell were you doing out so late at night!?"
"Going for a walk, checking the area. Y'know," Eve replied.
"Checking the area?!" Sarah said, almost screaming, "You were alone at night in the middle of the forest! There's no coyotes here!"
"Well," Eve said, "Also, making sure you were sleeping well."
"You did?"
"Yeah. It's my job to keep eggheads and nerds like you safe."
Sarah responded as she tightened Eve's bandage, "Pffft, us eggheads and nerds are perfectly capable, you know."
"Oh yeah?" Eve asked, "All brains, eh? So, genius, any idea what that thing was that bit me? I caught a glimpse of it. White insect-like thing. Never seen anything like it in all my time in the jungle."
"I don't know. I wish I could help. Sorry."
"No worries, Sarah," Eve said, smiling in a reassuring way.
Sarah was about to say something more when she noticed that Eve's smile was a little bit bigger than usual, "You OK?" Sarah shakily asked.
Eve looked at her with a curious expression and said, "You're blushing."
"I am not."
"Yes you are. You're also looking at my boobs, again."
Sarah didn't know what to say, so she just nodded her head.
"It's OK," Eve continued, "Now, why don't we catch a bit of shut eye?"
Sarah shyly asked, "Eve, you want me to you know, uh...keep watch in your tent or um...ahem...sleep with you. Not in that kind of way--!"
Eve giggled a bit and interrupted, "Nah, love, I'm a big gal, I can take care of myself."
She paused and then added, "Besides, I wouldn't want those brains of yours to be all tired. Tomorrow, we explore the Lost Ruins. I need you at your 100%"
Sarah replied, "Thanks, Eve. I'll see you in the morning."
Eve turned around and walked towards her tent. Sarah watched her go and soon went back into her own tent to catch what bit of sleep she could catch after a night of fright. Something was at the back of her mind, however.
What was that white "bug" that "bit" Eve? Where did it come from? What was it? Why did it bite Eve? And why did it suddenly make her boobs swell up?
Sarah knew it was probably nothing to worry about, but she couldn't stop thinking about it. She wondered if she would find an answer to her questions. She didn't know how long she would be with Eve, but she hoped it would last just a little bit longer.
She fell asleep and was hoping that tomorrow would be a good day.
The morning sun shone brightly as the 2 explorers woke up and had breakfast, exchanging a few words. The day was warm and humid, and the duo were prepared to make their way to the Lost Ruins. As they finished their meal, Sarah saw that Eve's breasts were still a bit swelled up from the previous night.
"Are you sure you're going to be OK?" Sarah asked. "It feels like that thing that bit you last night is still bothering you."
"Yeah," Eve replied, "I'll be fine. Just feeling a bit heavy for now."
Sarah said, "Well, at least let me take a look at your wound and see if I can figure something out."
"Sure," Eve said as she moved closer to Sarah.
Sarah grabbed the bandage and removed it. The wound had almost disappeared. It was a big red sore a few hours back. How can this be?
"Hmmm," Sarah said as she examined the wound, "This is strange."
Eve looked at Sarah and said, "What do you mean?"
"The wound. It healed quite fast in such a short timespan."
Eve laughed and said, "Awwww, my booboo is gone. Maybe that's cause genius was here."
Sarah giggled and said, "So, you want to see me as a hero?"
"I see a lot more than that," Eve said as she looked at Sarah's breasts.
Sarah blushed and said, "Eve!"
Eve replied, "Sorry, you are just so gorgeous. I've never met a woman as smart and as kind as you. You have no idea how awesome you are."
Sarah blushed even more, feeling quite awkward and didn't know how to respond to Eve's compliment. All she could do was smile and say, "Thanks, Eve."
"OK, we should get going."
The duo packed their things into their backpacks, smiled at one another and prepared for the journey to the Lost Ruins. It wasn't too far off. In fact, it was quite close by.
Official records claim that The Lost Ruins were built in the early 1500's by a tribe of explorers looking for a better way of life. Sadly, many explorers died when they attempted to live in the jungle.
Sarah was briefly explaining the fascinating history to Eve as they walked through the jungle. She couldn't help but be fascinated by her newfound friend. Sarah seemed to have such a deep knowledge of the jungle, especially its history.
"Well," Sarah said, "We will be there soon!"
"Good," Eve groaned and replied, "We can finally get this over with."
"Why? What's the hurry? You are not afraid are you?"
"No, it's just that I am so--well, I can't exactly describe it."
Sarah took another quick look at Eve's boobs. Still swelled up.
"Why do I feel like I'm leaking?!" Eve suddenly exclaimed. "Damnit, what's that on my shirt?!"
Sarah's eyes widened with surprise and she didn't know how to respond. It seemed like Eve was more frustrated than ever.
"Calm down," Sarah chimed in, "I am sure it is nothing to worry about."
Eve replied, "Well, it's not like these shirts are anything special anyways."
The 2 continued their trek through the jungle as Eve struggled with her swelled boobs and the leakage. Sarah looked over at Eve a few times to see how she was doing. So far, so beautiful (and voluptuous).
She could just stare at those breasts all day. But something else seemed to be bothering her. Something white, liquid-like, coming out from her, leaking from those boobs. It was strange and yet, intriguing in its own way.
"Sarah?" Eve said, snapping her back to reality.
"Oh, sorry. What is it?"
"We have arrived."
Sarah looked up and noticed the ruins for the 1st time, "WOW! What a splendid sight! I've seen it in documentaries and photos, but never in person! Eve, isn't it beautiful?"
Eve responded, "Yes. It is. I could say something similar about you."
Sarah blushed again and said, "Hehehehe, stop it. I am just as normal as everyone else, you know."
"Oh really? What do you call beautiful?"
Sarah blushed and said, "You. And those b--anyway, excuse me. Ahem. There's much work to be done. Let's get inside, shall we. Ahem."
Eve stopped and turned around. She looked at Sarah and said, "I'm so glad that you're here, Sarah. You are a great friend."
Sarah looked at Eve's face and gave her a big hug. Sarah could feel Eve's boobs press against her and it felt nice.
"I owe you for helping me back there," Eve said in a grateful tone. "Is something wrong? You look a bit pale."
"Nothing is wrong, Eve. It's just that you are my first real friend since I got here. I am so happy to have met you."
"Me too," Eve said. "By the way, my full name is Evelyn Meyers. I'm glad to share this with you, Sarah."
Sarah replied, "Gold, Sarah Gold. That's me. But, call me Sarah."
As they entered the ruins, Sarah saw that the place was quite large. It was definitely larger than she thought. She knew that Eve was quite knowledgeable about the subject matter, but seeing the actual site made it all seem so much more real.
Eve walked ahead, looking around intently and asking Sarah a bit more about the place. They were both amazed by the architecture and design. There was a massive structure in the center of the area.
It was circular and had columns supporting the roof. It was surrounded by smaller structures which served as living quarters, kitchens, storage and other functions. The entire complex was covered in vines and plants.
"Wow," Eve said, "This place is incredible!"
"Yes, it is," Sarah replied. "Yes it is..." Yet again, Sarah couldn't resist looking at Eve's boobs- still swollen, and Sarah was starting to get a bit aroused. She could feel herself getting turned on a bit.
"Sarah," Eve said, "I think we should start our exploration of the ruins."
Blushed, Sarah responded, "Oh, yes! Let's go."
Eve teased her a bit and said in an almost seductive tone, "I saw where your eyes were. I can tell that you like what you see."
Sarah blushed and said, "Well, I am not sure if you can blame me."
Eve laughed and said, "Come on. We have a lot to do."
They started walking around the perimeter of the circular building. The ground was dry. Sarah was wearing shorts and a tank top, but she had a light jacket to keep her warm.
Eve was wearing torn blue jeans and a red t-shirt. Both women were sweating and breathing heavily.
"Hey, Eve," Sarah said, "I don't know if you remember, but I was a bit worried about you last night. Really. However, that wound healed up pretty quick. Are you feeling nauseous, dizzy or out of the ordinary?"
Eve was moving some heavy rocks and managed to reply in between short breaths, "It's the jungle, hen. You're always gonna feel like shit here."
"OK," Sarah said, "I'll try to be careful."
Sarah was still a bit nervous and asked, "What if I get bit? Or, you know, something happens?"
Without a moment of hesitation, Eve moved towards Sarah and told her sternly, "I'm gonna make sure that NEVER happens."
"Eve, I-"
"Shh," Eve said as she placed her dusty finger on Sarah's lips, "Just trust me. I won't let that happen. It's my job, remember?"
Sarah smiled and nodded. She trusted Eve and felt quite aroused by Eve's touch (not to mention, the sight of those breasts).
The 2 continued to explore the ruins and soon discovered a small room in one of the outer walls.
"Look at this!" Sarah said excitedly.
"What's so special about this?" Eve inquired.
"It's a hidden passageway," Sarah said as she pointed to the wall, "And there are some symbols here. I think I can read them. Finally, a practical application of my skillset!"
"Really?" Eve asked, impressed with Sarah.
"Yeah. I have the ability to decipher old languages and symbols. It's been quite useful in the past. Look, here's the same symbol from the other side. See the similarity?"
Eve moved in closer, squinted a bit, and said, "Yeah, subtle. They look weird. Do you these symbols have meaning?"
"Yes, they do. But, I need to study them more. Let's hunker down here for a while."
"Hunker down? Big words, Sarah. Saying 'hunker down' is usually my thing. Guess some of my outdoors energy is rubbing off on you," Eve said in a flirty tone.
"Oh, haha, uh sure." Sarah said as she smiled a little. She then proceeded to study the symbols, while Eve got a camp area set up. After a few minutes, she said, "Hmm. There are 3 sets of symbols here."
Eve came over and said, "What? 3?"
"Yes, I found 3 different sets. Here, and here, and here."
"That's strange," Eve replied, "Why would there be more than 1 set?"
Sarah, engrossed in the symbols in front of her said, "Curious, they look like...they look like letters. Like, maybe the symbols represent a language."
"Letters? They look like tits!" Eve said, and laughed.
"Eve, that's actually...kind of...uh correct," Sarah said, almost shocked.
"I'm kidding, Sarah. You know me. Anyway, let's take a break. I am tired from all that walking and rock-clearing."
"Sure," Sarah replied. "I am also a bit tired. Maybe we should rest for a bit?"
Eve nodded in the affirmative and they sat down.
"So, what do you think, Sarah?" Eve asked.
"About what?"
"About the symbols. What do you think they REALLY mean?"
"I think I have an idea. I think they might be a language. I'm not sure, though. It looks like it could be a combination of symbols, letters, and numbers."
Eve chuckled a bit and said, "And the boobs theory?"
Sarah hesitated and responded, "Well, I mean, it's a possibility. There are quite a few statues and writings of a suggestive nature in this place. It's very possible that the builders were trying to convey something. I guess it's hard to say."
Eve said, "You're right. It is hard to say. But, whatever it may be, it's fascinating and hella fun to look at."
"Yup. Hella fun."
Sarah got up and began inspecting the symbols on the walls and said, "Look at this one. It has an inscription, doesn't it?"
"Yep. It's also some kind picture? What is that?" asked Eve as she stood up and moved to take a closer look.
"It looks like a drawing of a woman. Kind of. There's a headdress on and everything."
"Who is she?"
"I don't know. But I want to find out."
"Wait! said Eve, "There's someone else with her. Near her. On her...? I'm not sure. But it seems to be on her chest."
"I see it too."
"I don't think the writing is a language anymore!" Eve said, her voice filled with excitement, "It's not letters or numbers. It's bloody ancient porno!"
Sarah started laughing and said, "Eve, you're hilarious."
"No, seriously. It's some sort of sexual fantasy. Look at the way she's dressed. It's like a priestess or something. Look at the way she's holding that other lady. Cradling her."
Sarah looked closely and said, "Yup. I guess so."
"And look at those voluptuous breasts. Holy crap. And look at the way the other woman is positioned. It's like she's being held up. It's like...I'm not too sure. Help me out here, Sarah."
Sarah, too, was mesmerized by the image. "Maybe it's a ritual of sorts?"
"Nah," Eve said, "I don't think so. Look at the way the women are positioned. One is sort of cradling the other in her arms or something. It's like they're kissing, or something."
"I see it now. I think you're right. It's like they're embracing each other."
"I wonder what it means. Do you think it's a story? A myth?"
"Maybe."
"Or...wait...it looks like...is that...? Shit, I think it is!"
They both froze in place and stared intently at the symbols.
"What? What does it look like?" Sarah asked excitedly.
"I see the woman is cradling her partner and moving her closer to her tits," Eve replied, pointing to the symbol.
"No way! Are you kidding me? I've been staring at these for hours and missed that!" Sarah said excitedly.
"Yup. You got that right. And they do make a lovely couple. But, that's not the usual sex positions people used back then, right? Like, one of them would be on top?"
Sarah nodded in agreement. "You know, I actually thought about that before. These 2 are sitting. Both of them facing each other. They're almost holding hands. In the cradle position, as you mentioned earlier. But, what makes it even more interesting is the fact that there's 2 women in this very...uh--"
"Fun position," Eve said, with a slight grin on her sweaty face.
The 2 were still studying the symbols, exchanging ideas and what not.
"Fuckin' ell. I need to take a stroll, I feel heavy for some reason. You keep doing whatever it is you're doing, Sarah."
"OK, Eve!" Sarah said, lost in study of the symbols and (rather erotic) drawings on the wall.
Eve took her backpack and found a slightly secluded area, away from prying eyes. She proceeded to remove her shirt as well, revealing her own voluptuous breasts. Her nipples were hard and almost sticking out through her t-shirt.
She immediately noticed a white creamy substance leaking from both her nipples and the tops of her breasts.
"What in the hell?" Eve muttered. She quickly grabbed a cloth and wiped her breasts. The fluid, which appeared to be some form of milk, came out quite easily. She squeezed her tits a bit more, causing more of that same substance to come dripping out.
"Holy shit. Is this milk?" Eve asked herself, as she tried to figure this all out. She got some of that white stuff on her finger and tasted it (she was an explorer after all, so unusual tastes weren't a new thing to her).
"Oh my god. This is breast milk!" Eve almost screamed, "OK, but how?!"
Regardless, she put her shirt back on and went to see what Sarah was up to.
"Eve! You won't believe what I found! Come here! Where have you been? I need you to see this."
Eve moved towards Sarah and said, "Hey, what's up? Did you find something?"
"Yes, I did. But first, I need to show you something. I deciphered enough of the language on the walls, and the pictures fill in the rest. Or at least most of what happened here. Look!" Sarah said as she pulled a piece of parchment from her backpack.
She unrolled the paper, and Eve's jaw dropped when she saw the drawing of a woman, cradled in the arms of another woman.
"What's happening? What are they doing? Why are they so close? Look at their bodies. They are practically touching. Oh, my God. They are. They are-- Eve couldn't finish her sentence.
Sarah chimed in, "Adult breastfeeding. Erotic lactation. That's basically what was happening right where we're standing. It's all quite surreal. I forgot I had that parchment, but all your talk about boobs made me think a bit, y'know. I mean, this is just like well...um, nursing? But with and for adults."
Eve laughed and said, "I can see that. I guess that's why they are so close. I'm impressed you figured that one out. Speaking of adult nursing or whatever you called it, I once heard something about Romans doing this. Roman something it was called. I'm not even sure if it was Romans. Maybe you can fill in the blanks, eh history buff? You seem to know a lot."
"Yeah, I do. I studied a bit of ancient Rome. Not as much, though. Lemme think for a second. Roman Charity! I remember reading that somewhere and seeing the paintings. I'm not entirely sure about the specifics, but it involved something similar to what we're seeing. Only, instead of a woman and a man, THIS involves 2 women. I think."
"Wow. That's interesting. I never knew that. So, what are we looking at here? What is this place, anyway?"
"Well, I'll tell ya. I think this is a temple dedicated to a goddess or something. But, I'm not sure. I haven't seen any statues or anything. I think this place is empty. I mean, there are signs of habitation here, but nothing big. If this is a temple, it's pretty damn small. How do you think we should proceed?
Eve suggested, "Maybe take a peek deeper inside? See if there's any more details?"
"Great idea!!" Sarah said with excitement, "Let's go!"
As they walked around the perimeter, they searched for a way to enter the structure. They noticed there was no door to be seen anywhere. And then they both looked up and saw it: the statue of a woman cradling another woman in her arms, and all.
Sarah said, "That's odd. The women look like they are embracing each other. Like...latching on? And..." Sarah pointed at the drawing, "she's sucking her tits? Is that even possible? But, why, though?"
"Yeah. It kind of makes sense though, right? She's obviously nursing the other person. Anyway, I bet that's where the milk comes from. Sarah, there's something I need to..."
Sarah, not paying attention to what Eve was trying to say, noticed some strange writing on a wall. Her eyes followed the line and she saw some sort of symbol, along with a bunch of numbers that were just as peculiarly drawn.
Sarah said, "Eve, I think I found something else! Come take a look."
Eve, now curious, joined Sarah at the wall.
"Look at these symbols," Sarah said, pointing at the writing on the wall. "I can't read the whole thing, but the gist of it is the women here, well mainly women, were low on food supplies and getting hungry and desperate. So, they decided to induce lactation? But, how exactly did they do it?"
She gulps and goes on, "It's kind of weird, but it makes sense. I mean, I've been thinking about it for a while now, and it seems plausible. If the nipple receives enough oral stimulation, lactation would be induced and the body would produce the milk. Theoretically, of course. But, there's something missing here."
Eve said, "So they sucked each others' nipples? That's what you're saying? I mean, I guess it could work, but I don't think it's that simple. I think there's more to it than that."
"What do you mean? What else is missing?"
"Well, let's start with the pictures. There's a picture in the middle. One that keeps showing up. It looks like an 8, like a little bug or insect of sorts. I think it might be a symbol for a secret organization? But, that seems too outlandish."
Eve interrupted when she heard the word insect and said, "Insect? Sarah, there's something I really need to..."
Just as Sarah was about to turn around and listen to what Eve had to say, she felt the ground vibrating under her.
Sarah turned around and said, "Tremors. That can't be good. EVE! We better get out of here. NOW!"
Eve grabbed Sarah's hand and the duo ran as fast as they could, until they reached the entrance, which was still open. They both jumped in, and the door slammed shut behind them.
The tremors worsened, and Sarah and Eve looked at each other.
"We need to keep moving. To higher ground!" Sarah said.
"OK! Let's go, then!" Eve replied.
They started running again, but this time they were heading in the opposite direction of where they had come from. It wasn't long before the duo were separated. The tremors were getting much worse now and made it difficult for the 2 to keep up with one another.
Eventually, Eve found herself lost. She tried to move forward, but after running for a long time, she was completely out of breath and unsure of where she was going.
Eve yelled out, "Sarah! SARAH! Can you hear me! Are you there?!"
She could only assume that Sarah was running somewhere too, and was now lost as well. The shaking increased in intensity, until everything started to go dark. Everything seemed so calm at first. Then the darkness just engulfed her. She couldn't see anything; not even herself.
Not even a hint of light in the distance.
Luckily, Eve never left home without a trusty (but horribly old) wind-up dynamo flashlight from WWI. She bought it for quite a bargain along with other trinkets at a local pawn shop. After pulling that string for some time, the light finally flickered on.
Eve was able to find the strength to take off her pack and use it to wipe some sweat from her brow. She noticed she had all the extra food rations in her backpack.
"Fuck!" said Eve, realizing the fact that Sarah didn't have any food. "What am I going to do now? Oh God." She put the pack down and sat down on a rock, putting her face in her hands and sobbing.
The shaking subsided and she saw the light from her "flashlight" begin to get dimmer. Eve began to panic. She rummaged around her backpack and was relieved to find a bar of chocolate. She took out the wrapper and hurriedly munched down on it.
As Eve was finishing up her last bite of the chocolate, the light was about to go off. She started to cry a bit more. She realized that Sarah was nowhere in sight. She just wanted to see her again. She wanted to hug her. She wanted to do a lot more than that, too.
One thing is for sure- Sarah undoubtedly felt the same way.
Eve screamed out in to the distance, "Sarah! Why!? Please forgive me! I should never have let go of your hand. You egghead. Nerd. All I had was 1 job. 1 fucking job." Eve then got up, but as she was about to do so, she slipped, and almost went down the big, gaping hole near her.
However, her backpack wasn't so lucky and went down.
"Noooo!" Eve said as she realized that the rest of her pack was gone. She still had her flashlight, though, but she was able to quickly get at least 1 small bowl of rice. The backpack was finally gone, but she still had some of her precious flashlight left. That wind-up wasn't too bad after all.
Eve took off her t-shirt and used it as a cloth to wipe her dusty, sweat-drenched face and body. She realized her breasts were feeling a bit heavy again. It had happened a few times since the insect bite, and she had no idea why. The whole milk-leakage thing was becoming a bit of a nuisance, though.
Eve thought for a moment and took off her shirt again. She then noticed something new: milk leaking out, like a river, from her nipples. It was like a faucet; leaking, but not constantly. Eve rubbed her nipples to relieve a bit of the pressure and suddenly more milk began to shoot out from her nipples.
"Oh my God!" Eve muttered, with a bit of uncertainty in her voice, "Something is seriously out of wack here. If only I had Sarah and her big brainy brain to explain what the hell's wrong with me. Oh, Sarah. Where are you?"
Eve's eyes teared up and she began to sob again. The tears were mixed with a bit of her own milk as well. It was now dripping down her cheeks and neck. She just wanted to see Sarah again. She wanted to hold her again. She wanted to do a lot more than that, too.
Sadly, Sarah was nowhere to be found. Eve called out Sarah's name for some time, but there was no response.
Sarah was running for her life. She was afraid of dying and losing Eve, but she had to find her. She couldn't let Eve down again. Not when things were going so well between them. Sarah's mind was still racing. She wasn't paying attention to where she was going as she ran through the ruins, but she was trying her best to get away from the source of the tremors.
Sarah thought, "I hope Eve's OK. I should have never let go of her hand. God, I--I miss her already. I need to find her. But, how? She could be anywhere!"
Sarah continued to run until she reached a dead-end. There was a huge pile of rubble in front of her. It was like a giant wall.
Sarah's stomach immediately started to rumble.
"Hungry. Haven't eaten in hours, now. That's not good. I need to find something quick."
Sarah took out a piece of half-eaten chocolate from her pocket. She removed the wrapper and munched down on it. The chocolate was long gone by now.
Sarah was sitting in a small opening on the ground, right at the top of the huge pile of rocks. The tremors had subsided (for now). Sarah didn't know what to do. She was scared, tears profusely rolling down her cheeks.
She cried out, "EVE! WHERE ARE YOU! EVELYN! ARE YOU THERE?"
Nothing.
Sarah continued to cry. She put her hands on her face and sobbed. Her clothes were sweaty and dirty, but she didn't care. Sarah wanted to go home, but she knew that survival in such a place was next to impossible. She thought about Eve, and what she was going through.
"I'm so sorry, Eve," Sarah said, wiping her tears, "I hope you can forgive me. I need you, Eve. C'mon, I really need you. I...want you."
Sarah lay her head down, still teary eyed and fell asleep for a while. She woke up sometime later and stretched her body, still thinking about Eve.
"I'm tired. I'm hungry. And I need to find something to eat soon. I wish I had my backpack. Or my share of the rations. Damnit."
Sarah sat up, still with her hands on her face, and looked around. She was in a small room, so she got up and made her way into the adjacent room. She was quite happy to find a couch, but made of stone. There was also a bit of dust, but not too much.
Sarah was starving. She tried to search for anything edible, but there was nothing to be found. She gave up and sat on the peculiar-looking stone couch. It was actually quite comfy. She laid her head down, curled up, and started to fall asleep yet again.
Suddenly, she heard a faint sound coming from behind her. It sounded like...what was it? Suddenly, a dim light. Sarah was startled, but she couldn't figure out where the light was coming from. She slowly turned around, and saw a small, glowing object in the corner of the room.
"What the hell is that? A flashlight??! Eve! Is that you?"
The light moved closer, and then Sarah saw Eve in the distance, illuminated by the light of her flashlight.
"Eve! Oh, thank God!"
"Sarah! Sarah, I'm so glad to see you!"
Eve ran over to Sarah and embraced her tightly. "I've been so worried about you. Are you OK? What happened to you?"
"I'm fine. Just a little shaken up. I don't know how, but I managed to escape the tremors. I found this cave, and it's pretty safe.
Still holding each other, Sarah said to Eve, "Eve, there's something I wanna say to you. I'm sorry for everything. I s--should never have let go of your hand. I was stu--stupid. I shouldn't have done that. I'm so sorry."
Eve smiled and said, "It's OK, Sarah. And, I'm sorry for letting you go."
The duo looked into each others eyes and leaned in for a kiss.
"Eve, I really like you. I feel safe when I'm around you. I want to--"
"Sarah, just kiss me. Please, just do it. Kiss me. Right now. Right here. Kiss me, Sarah."
They both kissed each other passionately. Sarah could taste Eve's salty, sweet lips. Sarah was aroused.
"Eve, you're amazing...but I feel a bit dizzy. I, uh...haven't eaten in hour--"
Sarah almost fell down, but Eve grabbed her, held her, and whispered, "I'm sorry. I lost all the food and I had to eat the last ration, I had no other choice. Please forgive me. Sarah, stay here. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of that. You just rest. I'm gonna go find food."
Sarah sat back down on that "couch" made of stone.
As Eve got up and went out to look for food, Sarah said, "Eve...your...breasts...figured out why they're so big, haven't ya? I mean, only 1 logical conclusion- milk. White bug...in jungle...bit, can't explain in-depth, but it's t--true."
Eve thought to herself, "Milk. Sarah. Hungry. Breastfeeding. Pictures and symbols all over the ruins. It all makes sense. My breasts are full of milk. The white insect is the one who bit me. The bite caused the lactation! It's all connected. But, why did it have to happen to me?"
Eve, still piecing the puzzle in her head approached Sarah, "Listen, Sarah, I know this is gonna sound a bit, well, awkward, but I'm lactating. My boobs are heavy and leaking and well, you know..."
"Oh my God. You are? Really?"
"Yeah. They're getting big. The milk is coming out of my nipples. Why don't I, well, um..."
Sarah interrupted, "Breastfeed me? Yes. I'm hungry and tired and thirsty and you're the only one here, so I guess we'll try that. It's the only thing left to do. I can imagine how the people here felt when they were going through a similar predicament."
Eve removed all of her clothes, not just her shirt, but her pants as well. Sarah was shocked. It was the 1st time she was seeing Eve's bare breasts. She was amazed by the size of her tits. They were enormous and firm, but soft, too.
Eve said, "Now, why don't we try that cradle position we saw on all those walls?"
Sarah, still wearing her clothes, took them off as well. They assumed the position (just like they had both seen on the walls) and Sarah opened her mouth, placed it on Eve's tit and began to suckle on those large, round, milky breasts.
Sarah was in heaven. She was sucking on Eve's breast, drinking her milk. It was delicious (and quite filling!)
She had never tasted anything so good in her entire life.
Sarah was still nursing on Eve's tit when Eve asked, "So, Sarah. How do you feel? Do you like it?"
Sarah stopped sucking for a bit, looked up at Eve and replied, "Yes, I love it. I've never had anything so wonderful in my life."
Eve smiled, held Sarah's head, and delicately guided her back onto the tit to continue suckling.
Sarah took her time, savoring every drop of milk that she could. This was truly amazing and Sarah never wanted it to end. She had never imagined such a thing would ever be possible, but somehow destiny made it happen.
Eve was enjoying the experience as well. She loved the sensation of Sarah's tongue on her nipple, and she was getting hornier by the minute. She could feel her pussy beginning to get wet.
Eve, still cradling Sarah and breastfeeding her, reached down to Sarah's wet pussy and began fingering it. She was surprised by the amount of lubricant that came out of Sarah's cunt. Eve's fingers were gliding smoothly inside Sarah's hot, wet hole.
Sarah moaned in between suckling. Eve continued to finger her new friend, this time moving her hands faster and deeper into Sarah's wet, beautiful pussy.
Sarah was moaning louder now, and Eve could tell that she was close to an orgasm. She decided to stop feeding Sarah for a while and just concentrate on pleasuring her with her hands.
With milk leaking from her mouth, Sarah looked up at Eve and asked for a kiss. Eve obliged and the 2 women shared a passionate kiss. Sarah's hands played with Eve's breasts.
Eve was so horny. While still kissing, Eve returned to fingering Sarah. But, she also felt Sarah's pussy begin to throb, and knew she was about to come soon.
Sarah's moaning grew louder. "Oh, Eve! Do--Don't stop! It feels so good! Oh FUCK!"
Eve couldn't take it anymore and began pumping her fingers into Sarah faster. She was having an orgasm. Her own. She began to spurt and squirt liquid out of her pussy while still kissing Eve. Her juices were dripping down like a river.
Eve continued nursing Sarah in the cradle position, this time, holding Sarah tighter and closer than ever before.
Sarah had now moved on to suckling from Eve's other breast, which was still heavy, full of milk begging to be sucked out and swallowed. Ms. Gold was more than happy to oblige.
Sarah continued to nurse on Eve. She was so horny, but she didn't want to come yet.
Eve whispered to Sarah, "Swallow, it love. Don't waste. Drink that sweet milk. Now I know why that insect bit me back in the jungle. It's all so clear now. That little white creature is a survivor, like us. And that's why it bit me, so I could make milk. So, we could resolve this moment. So I could save your life. I'm not alone. In here, we're surrounded by women who did the same, a long time ago."
Sarah moaned in between suckles and nodded her head, agreeing with Eve's assessment. Destiny aside, Sarah was in heaven. She was sucking on Eve's huge tits, drinking her milk, and feeling Eve's warm, rugged, skin. She was in a trance.
Eve was loving every bit of it, too. She bobbed Sarah's head up and down as she suckled, making sure to drink her fill.
Sarah's eyes were closed, and she was lost in ecstasy. She kept drinking until the last drop of life saving, liquid goodness.
Sarah opened her eyes and looked straight into Eve's eyes, and said, "Thank you, Eve. Thank you so much. You really saved me. If it wasn't for you, I would've started eating my arm off."
Eve smiled, kissed Sarah passionately and said, "You're welcome. I'm just doing my job, love. And I hope you'll stay with me here for a while. I wanna hold you. I wanna feel your skin touch mine. I want to kiss you again."
Sarah smiled and said, "I'd love that. I wanna be like this forever. Cradled, safe in your warm and loving embrace. I'm so horny. Let's do it right here in the cradle. I'm so wet already. Let's have some more fun, Eve. Is that OK with you, love?"
Eve smiled and nodded in the affirmative. Sarah and Eve stayed in the cradle position for a long time, just looking into each others' eyes, and making out. Both were so happy and content.
After what seemed like a very, very, VERY long time, Sarah and Eve decided to just cuddle and spoon, on the stone couch, facing each other.
"This is so nice. I love being in your arms, Eve. I'm so thankful for this time together. I'm so grateful to you for all your help. You're a lifesaver. Literally! You saved me twice."
Eve smiled, kissed Sarah, and said, "I know. But, admit it, the 2nd time was way sexier than that episode in the jungle."
Sarah replied, "Well, you were quite brave, that kinda turned me on a bit."
Eve smiled, said, "I get it. But, I wouldn't call myself brave. It was actually pretty scary. I panicked."
Sarah smiled, touched her neck and said, "How could I ever repay you? What can I give you, Eve, to show my gratitude? Anything."
"Nothing is required of you. I'm glad to see you alive. I'm just doing my job."
"Eve, how would you like me to perform cunnilingus? That pussy of yours is wetter than a scuba diver! I'm dying to lick you!"
"Really??" Eve said, surprised by Sarah's enticing offer.
Eve sat up straight while Sarah got down on her knees and crawled towards Eve's crotch. Sarah used her hand to guide her along the way. She could smell the sweet aroma of Eve's wet pussy.
When she finally reached the prize, she let her tongue out and licked the top of Eve's pussy.
Sarah gently lapped up the juice that leaked from the pussy, then she stuck her tongue inside and began licking Eve's clit.
Eve moaned, "Mmmmm, yesssss! SARAH GOLD! Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh. That feels soooooooo good!"
Sarah continued to eat Eve's pussy, using her tongue and lips to stimulate and pleasure the clit.
Eve was panting loudly, moaning in between sucks and licks. Sarah was getting aroused and, in return, she was eating Eve's pussy even harder. She was loving the taste of Eve's pussy. It was so creamy and sweet. It was definitely worth the wait.
They continued to make out and fondle each other's bodies. Sarah's tongue was deep inside Eve's pussy. Eve wrapped her legs around Sarah's head and pulled her down to the pussy. She was moaning louder and louder.
Sarah began sucking on the clit, her tongue pushing in and out of the wet pussy. Eve was moaning. All she could do was push against Sarah's face. Sarah had been waiting for this moment for a long time. Now, it was finally happening!
"Oh, Sarah, love. I think I'm gonna come. Ooohhhhhhhhhhh. Aaaaahhhh. Oh, Sarah, I'M COMING!"
Sarah continued to suck hard on that clit, rapidly pushing her tongue in and out of Eve's wet pussy.
"Ooohhhhhhh, Sarah! Yes, yes, yes, yes! I'm coming! Oooooooohhhhhh, Sarah, OHHHHHHHHHH, Sarah, I'm coming! Ooohhhhhhhh!"
Eve's eyes rolled into the back of her head and she screamed loudly, her body shaking. The entire cave was filled with the sound of Eve's loud screams and Sarah's tongue sucking on that clit.
Sarah then proceeded to hug Eve, still riding the wave of her orgasm, and kiss her on the neck and face. Eve was breathing heavily and was trying to catch her breath. She was moaning softly.
Sarah said, "Oh, Eve...I think we should...rest...now. We need to rest if we are going to get out of here--"
Eve stroked Sarah's cheek gently, looked into her eyes and said, "I agree. I'm exhausted. But, before we go to sleep, I really want to show you something."
She took Sarah's hand and led her to the back of the cave. There was a small opening that was covered by a curtain. Eve pushed the curtain aside and they entered the room.
Inside was a large, stone statue. A statue of a naked woman, lying on her side. Her breasts were exposed, and Sarah noticed that the breasts were quite swelled up.
Eve said, "This is her. I can't explain it. I felt drawn to this room. To you. It's like I can feel her embrace, her telling me to breastfeed you. To save you. It's all so weird and wonderful."
Sarah looked at the statue and wondrously said, "She's beautiful."
Eve smiled and dreamily added, "I think she is beautiful too. I'm so lucky to be here with you now. Sharing this moment."
Sarah and Eve went back, still naked, got on the floor, cuddled together, exchanged kisses, and fell asleep.
It was a beautiful night. It was cold outside and both women were very warm and comfortable in the cozy cave.
Sarah dreamed of the jungle, of the Lost Ruins. In her dream, she heard a woman's voice calling out to her, "Sarah Gold."
Sarah, still asleep, was fully aware of her name being called in this dream. She replied, "Who's there?"
The voice came back saying, "Sarah. The woman sleeping besides you. She saved your life, Sarah. NEVER FORGET THAT. I too was once like you. Desperate, dying. Hungry, thirsty. Destiny made it possible for another woman, much like your brave companion, to produce nectar from her bosom to keep me alive. To please me, so that I could please her in return."
Sarah opened her eyes and said, "Yes...I'm here. We're here." She then turned her eyes and took yet another look at Eve's lovely, beautiful breasts, which were slowly swelling up again. Eve's nipples were erect and pointing to the ceiling. Her nipples were dark brown and swollen, almost as big as saucers, begging to be sucked on and squeezed hard by Sarah's hands.
"Patience," Sarah muttered to herself as she slowly drifted off to sleep again.
Eve was deep in sleep. After such a time of immense (and intense) activity, she was extremely tired. Her dreams were visited by another woman.
This strange woman called out, "Evelyn Meyers, you have shown great courage in the face of great adversity. You took it onto yourself to save your lowly companion with your life-saving nectars. You brought her close to your bosom and saved her. Pleased her. She pleased you in return. Destiny always meant for this to happen."
The mystical voice continued, "You and your venerable companion, like us, are survivors. You have found each other. Be grateful, Eve, that you have met someone who needs you just as much as you need her. Someone you can trust. You're not alone anymore."
"Oh, thank you," Eve whispered as she too slowly drifted off to sleep.
The next morning, Sarah woke up and looked over at Eve, and saw that she was about to wake up. She thought it would be a good idea to wake her up early. Sarah leaned in to give Eve a light kiss on the cheek and said, "Good morning, love."
"Hello, Sarah," Eve replied, rubbing her eyes.
Eve gave Sarah a tongue-kiss and said, "Let's get out of this place, Sarah. We learned what we needed to. Although, it's doubtful anyone will believe us when we tell them what happened here. They probably won't even bother listening to our story. It sounds like a fuckin' fairy tale. Maybe, it is. But, I don't care. I'm out. I need you, Sarah. I want to go home."
Sarah smiled, kissed Eve on the lips, stroked her, and said, "Me too, love. Let's get dressed. I know where exactly the exit is."
The duo got dressed and packed what they could. Then, they made their way to the exit of the cave and headed towards the entrance of the Lost Ruins, still unharmed by the tremors.
Sarah and Eve, holding hands, turned around and took 1 last look at the Lost Ruins.
Sarah asked, "Will you miss this place?"
Eve replied, "I've got mixed feelings about it all. On 1 hand, I got to meet you, on the other, we nearly lost our lives. And, we didn't find anything. No gold. Nothing. Just a bunch of ruins. Not much to show for all the effort. I guess you win some, you lose some. Or, maybe, we just weren't meant to find those treasures."
Sarah chimed in, "Eve, these people...they didn't have much to begin with. All they had was each other. Even though they were up against all odds, they got together, banded together, and held out. Survived. That's what matters most."
Both women laughed, embraced, and passionately kissed each other.
Eve chimed in, "Sarah, how did they perish? I saw bones, a lot down there. I know some of them managed to escape the ruins and move on, but not all of them made it out, right?"
Sarah, in a pensive tone, said, "True, they kept each other alive for a time. But, soldiers eventually found them and started massacring them, a few managed to flee. It was awful. Horrible. The soldiers killed everyone in sight. Everyone. All in the name of revenge, I suppose. For what? Revenge against people who didn't have much? It's sad. Why?!"
Eve put her hand around Sarah's shoulders, said nothing, and stared at the ruins. The duo walked through the forest for an hour, carefully avoiding the dangerous parts of the jungle. Finally, after walking for a long time, they saw the sun peeking its head above the horizon.
Sarah took another look at Eve's body and said, "You're looking amazing. As always. I think we're ready to start our journey back home. Back to our lives."
Eve smiled, nodded in agreement and said, "I think I am too. But, why don't we set up camp here? Let's not take any risks, Sarah. After all that's happened, I need to stop being so harsh and foolish. I've had many encounters with near-death, but nothing as frightening as what went down in those bloody Ruins."
She deeply sighed, "I think I'm done with the jungle for a while. I think I'm ready to settle down, get a job in the city. Maybe I can teach, or write a book or something."
Sarah smiled, hugged Eve, and said, "I'm glad you feel that way. I think I'm also ready to settle down. Maybe I could change careers. Something a bit more mundane would be good after all that's happened here. Yes, mundane. Maybe I can help you write that book? I'm sure it'll be a bestseller. It's definitely a fascinating story in the making, hehe."
Eve, in a flirty tone, chimed in, "And a very sexy one. I doubt if it'll ever get published."
They both laughed, hugged again, stared into each other's eyes, moved closer together, and started making out
The 2 women were making out passionately, Sarah was kissing every inch of Eve's body.
The 2 women were laying on top of a flat moss-covered ground at the edge of the jungle. They continued to make out in the midst of their passionate embrace. Sarah then slid her hand underneath Eve's body and found her hot and wet pussy.
Eve had a burning desire for Sarah. Sarah was now grinding against Eve's soft, slippery pussy lips and rubbing up against her hardening clit. The 2 women kissed even more intensely.
Suddenly, Eve got the notion to remove Sarah's shirt so that she could give those tits a bit of oral stimulation. She quickly reached inside her trousers, unzipped them and took off her panties as well. Sarah did the same thing and soon, they were completely nude.
They continued kissing as Eve's tongue slowly made its way down to Sarah's neck. Then, she stuck out her tongue and licked Sarah's neck and shoulder.
Eve then moved her face down to Sarah's breasts. Her mouth was in front of 1 nipple while her hands were cupping both of Sarah's breasts and squeezing them. Both women moaned in pleasure as Eve kissed and sucked on Sarah's round breasts and perky nipple.
Sarah put her hand over Eve's head and gently pushed her on top of her, moving Eve's mouth closer to Sarah's throbbing nipple. Sarah then grabbed Eve's hair and guided her to the other breast.
Sarah, now with a hungry look in her eyes said, "Eve, I want to see you suck on my other tit. Show me what you've got, hen. Let's see how much you can suck on."
Eve smiled at Sarah, kissed her deeply and replied, "I have all night for that, hen. All goddamn night."
And, so they did. Eve went for Sarah's nipples like there was no tomorrow, licking it, kissing it, sucking it. The 2 women were moaning loudly as Eve showed Sarah exactly how much she enjoyed giving oral pleasure to someone.
She didn't stop until Sarah's entire body was shaking and vibrating with pleasure.
Finally, when Eve thought Sarah was ready to explode into an orgasmic frenzy, she intensified the pleasurable sensations by placing her finger inside Sarah's wet pussy and fingering her while her mouth lathered up and down on Sarah's hard nipple. Finally, it wasn't enough for Eve. She wanted more. She needed more.
She wanted to feel Sarah's juices squirt out of her pussy. She wanted to taste her. She wanted to swallow it all. So, she stopped sucking on Sarah's nipple and moved her face down to Sarah's pussy. She licked Sarah's slit from bottom to top, using her tongue to lick up and down Sarah's moist, pink, swollen pussy lips.
Then, she stuck out her tongue and licked Sarah's clitoris and sucked on it.
Sarah was now screaming, "Oh god! OH, GOD!!"
Eve knew that Sarah was going to come soon. She moved her face back up to Sarah's nipple and began sucking on it again, whilst fingering Sarah's wet, throbbing pussy. Sarah came hard and loud. She screamed, "Oh fuck yes. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, OH GOD YESSSS!"
Eve kept sucking on those tits, and after a while, moved her mouth up to Sarah's ear and whispered, "That was good, wasn't it, Sarah? You liked it, didn't you? I did."
Sarah, in a daze, replied, "Yes, I loved it. Every second of it. I've never felt anything so intense before. I've been wanting you since I first laid my eyes on you. I've been thinking about you ever since you saved me from that ocelot. Oh, Evelyn, I'm so fucking horny for you!"
Eve, whispering into Sarah's ear, said, "Let me cradle you and breastfeed you, again. I need to feel your warmth and sweetness. I need to hold you close. I want to give you everything you deserve, Sarah. Everything. I'd do anything for you."
Sarah, completely flushed, eagerly replied, "Just like last time? You promise to hold me, to guide my mouth to your sweet milky tits? I need to nurse and drink your milk. I feel so hungry after coming."
Eve smiled, kissed Sarah, and said, "I've got you, love. Let's get into position."
Sarah looked into Eve's eyes and said, "Yes, I'm all yours."
Eve, in a seductive tone, whispered, "I want to give you all you need, Sarah. I'll show you what it feels like to be truly held. I'll show you what it means to be loved and cared for. I'll show you what it means to be TRULY loved. It's a feeling unlike any other. Don't you think?"
Sarah nodded in agreement, smiled at Eve, and said, "Yes, I do."
Eve cradled Sarah in her arms, took her head, and gently placed it on her shoulder. She then took Sarah's mouth in hers and kissed her passionately. Next, she slowly moved Sarah's mouth to her leaking breasts and let her suckle on them.
Eve watched as Sarah nursed on her breasts, licked up and down her hard nipples, and moaned in pleasure.
When Eve was sure that Sarah was latched on and drinking that sweet milk, she said, "Sarah, you're so beautiful. You have the most amazing body. I wish we could stay here forever. I wish I could keep you with me always. But, I know that's not possible. We've got a long way to go. Our own lives to live. Our own paths to take."
Sarah, still nursing on her breasts, replied (in between suckles), "Yes, we do. But, for now, let's just enjoy this moment. Let's make it last. F--For as long as we can."
Eve, kissing Sarah's forehead, replied, "For as long as we can. Yes, we will. Yes, we will."
Eve moved Sarah to the next boob and nursed her while she continued rocking her and holding her tighter. After a while, Eve brought Sarah's head up to kiss her and said, "Sarah, that was amazing. You've no idea how good your tongue and mouth feel in my tits. Have another taste."
Sarah, with milk dripping out of her mouth, smiled at Eve, "I know. This is better than any meal at any restaurant I've ever been to. This is what I need. Your milk. I'm so glad you're my friend, Evelyn. Thank you for sharing your milk with me. For saving me. It's the best thing I've ever tasted."
Eve felt Sarah's hand try to slide down to her wet pussy and started fingering her. Sarah's finger found her clitoris and started rubbing it with increasing intensity.
"You are such a naughty girl," Eve teased, kissing Sarah again.
Sarah responded, "And, you are the best lover I have ever had. The sexiest, hottest, and bravest woman. The one who gave me the greatest gift. Saving my life. And, the one who gives me the biggest orgasms ever. The one who makes me come harder and longer than anyone ever has. The one who gives me the greatest pleasure."
She added, "Someone I can trust. Someone who understands me and knows how to treat me right. A TRUE best friend. The one I am willing to share myself with. To be vulnerable with."
Eve nodded in agreement, kissed Sarah again, and replied, "You make me feel good! I can't put it in words! I feel at ease when I'm around you, Ms. Gold."
They both laughed at this moment of pure love and lust.
"Eve, you haven't come yet. Why don't I go down on that wet pussy of yours," Sarah offered, as she continued to rub her clit rapidly. She looked into Eve's eyes and said, "I want you to see what your pussy tastes like."
Eve was feeling really horny now.
Sarah chimed in, "Why don't you sit on my face? Put your pussy on my face and lemme lick it for you?"
Eve smiled, sat down on Sarah's face, spread her legs wide open, and pushed her lovely pink lips onto Sarah's waiting tongue. As soon as they were together, Sarah started licking up and down Eve's slit, getting every last drop of juices from her sweet dripping cunt.
As Sarah licked and sucked on her hot, slippery pussy, Eve began gasping louder and moaning louder. Eve took hold of Sarah's head and began moving it back and forth vigorously, making sure that all of Sarah's mouth could get access to her clitoris. It wasn't long before Eve had 2 strong orgasms.
She came hard, but Sarah kept licking until Eve finally stopped bucking her hips. After a while, she recovered enough to say, "Oh, tha--that felt so good, Sarah!"
Sarah grinned and replied, "It did feel very nice, didn't it?"
Then, the 2 women cuddled up close, spooned (facing each other) for a while, and fell asleep with their arms wrapped around each other. They made out lightly during this time. After some time, both Sarah and Eve's breathing became heavy again. Both women were still awake.
They were still horny.
Eve said, "We should go to sleep. We've got a long day ahead of us tomorrow."
Sarah said, "Yes, we do. Goodnight, Ms. Meyers. Goodnight, mi amor."
Eve replied in a seductive tone, "Goodnight, mi amor."
The 2 women kissed once more, and then Sarah said, "Sweet dreams, Eve."
Eve replied, "Sweet dreams, Sarah."
And, so they did, safe in each other's warm, loving embrace.
After a decent time of deep sleep, the duo woke up.
Eve said, "Good morning, sleepy head. Got your beauty sleep?"
Sarah rubbed her eyes, stroked her hair, and replied, "Yeah, I guess. I feel really good. You?"
Eve smiled and said, "I'm fine. How are you?"
Sarah replied, "I'm good. REALLY GOOD. I feel great!"
Eve said, "I'm glad. I know I'm going to feel even better when I give you a kiss. Come here."
Sarah smiled, said, "I can't wait."
Eve took Sarah's hand, and said, "Ah, fuck it."
The 2 leaned in and passionately kissed one another, tongues dancing wildly in each other's mouths.
After a minute or 2 of hot, early-morning smooching, Eve broke the kiss, smiled at Sarah, and said, "You look wonderful this morning. I can't believe we're doing this. I mean, I can't believe we ACTUALLY DID IT! We survived. We made it."
Sarah replied, "Yes, we do. And, I can't believe it either. I feel so alive. I feel like a different person. That experience in the Lost Ruins changed me. It changed us, Eve. Let us strive to be better people, more compassionate towards and understanding of others. To do good. To help those less fortunate. I feel like I've found something that I never knew I was looking for."
Eve said, "I agree. I'm glad I met you. I'm glad I was there to save you."
Sarah cheekily replied, "It was a part of your job, after all, wasn't it?"
Eve laughed, and said, "True. But, it was more than that. It was fate. It was destiny. It was love. It was an act of selfless compassion. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. To us. I guess you could say I went above and beyond. In more ways than one, eh, eh?"
The duo exchanged a few words, got dressed, and headed back to what one could call "civilization" for the first time in days.
Once they were back, the 2 women immediately set about packing their things in suitcases, checking their passports, and making sure the flight wasn't delayed or cancelled.
Sarah needed to get back to Glastonbury. Her job, apartment, her life, her education was there. Eve, however, was having a bit of an issue.
With tears rolling down her eyes, Eve said, "Sarah, what we've had is truly magical. I will remember it forever. I can't--I won't stop thinking about it. But, I've lived here for nearly half a decade. I can't just leave with you. I'd love to, believe me, but I can't. I feel drawn to this place. It's hard to put into words. I hope--I hope you're not angry with me. I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble or got your hopes up."
Sarah, wiping away the tears in her eyes, replied, "No, Eve. Not at all. You've done nothing wrong. Why would I ever harbor any resentment against you? You saved me. I owe you. It's not the other way around. YOU saved MY life. I'll always be grateful to you. But, it doesn't change the fact that I need to get back home. I need to go back to my life."
Eve simply said, "I understand."
Sarah embraced Eve tightly, kissed her, and said, "Thank you for everything. I'm going to miss you. I'm so glad I met you. You've given me the best gift anyone has ever given me. If you're ever in Glastonbury, you promise to give me a call or drop by my place? I don't care how long it'll take. I just want to see you. I just want you to hold me again."
Eve hugged Sarah back, smiled, kissed her, and said, "Of course I will. Sarah, I believe it's my destiny to help others here. To save their lives if it ever comes to that. Hypothetically speaking, you wouldn't take issue if I had to well...y'know, breastfeed someone else, right?"
Sarah replied, "Who am I to stand in the way of destiny? Follow it. I'm glad you're happy. I'm glad you found a purpose here. I'm also glad you found happiness. I'm glad of the hot, sexy passion we were able to share with each other. The vulnerabilities we showed one another. The love. I'm glad of the friendship we developed. I'm glad we shared our love with one another."
She sniffed, "I'm glad you helped me find my purpose in life. I'm glad I was able to show you mine. Thank you, Evelyn Meyers. You are the best friend I have ever had. I love you. I love you with all of my heart."
Eve wistfully replied, "I love you too, Sarah Gold."
The duo shared 1 last passionate kiss, and then parted ways.
Sarah boarded her flight back to Glastonbury.
Eve's remained in the area, waiting for her next "gig". Her next person or persons to protect and (possibly) nurse, should circumstances dictate.
She went back to her small apartment, unpacked her things, and went for a nice long shower, washing away all of the grime and sweat from her adventures in the Lost Ruins.
When she was finished, she sat down on her bed, took off her underwear, laid back, and started thinking of Sarah. She thought about what they had done together. What they were able to share with one another.
Their lovemaking. Their friendship. Their trust. The intimacy.
Eve thought of Sarah's beautiful smile, her soft touch, her sweet voice, and her gentle kisses. Eve started to finger herself, slowly at first, but quickly picking up speed. She let out a loud moan, and came hard. She came harder than she ever had before. She felt her body tense up, and her pussy gushed juices all over her fingers.
"Oh, Sarah! Oh, Sarah!" Eve cried out.
She came again and again, until her orgasm subsided. She lay on her back, panting heavily, trying to catch her breath.
After a while, she wiped her hand clean with a towel, put her panties back on, and fell asleep.
Sarah's flight had just landed. She took a taxi back to her apartment. Once back, she took a quick shower. While in the shower, she thought of Eve. She couldn't stop thinking about her. Sarah missed her already.
While still there, she started touching herself and thinking about Eve. She came again. This time, though, it was a lot stronger than usual. She felt a surge of energy, and her climax lasted longer and was much more intense.
"Oh, Eve! Eve...!" Sarah, gently cried out.
Sarah dried off, got dressed, and went to bed. She laid down and slowly drifted off into a deep slumber.
And, there ends our erotic tale of Sarah Gold and Evelyn Meyers, their adventures, and the passion and love shared between them.
Story 3: Sophia x Maria
Note: Breastfeeding. One of my earlier works. I really don't know of a more "creative" title, sorry.
Sophia and Maria had been friends since college. They had always been close, but lately, their friendship had taken a deeper, more intimate turn.
They found themselves growing more and more attracted to each other, so much that they were no longer able to keep their hands off of one another when they were alone together.
One day while Maria was over at Sophia's house doing some homework, the 2 women discovered something else they both enjoyed, that being one another's tits! The girls laid down on the couch and started kissing, exploring each others' mouths with their tongues.
After several minutes of this, Sophia broke away from her girlfriend's mouth long enough to point to her own chest, "Maria...those are nice breasts you have there."
Maria couldn't believe what she was hearing. Her special friend had just told her that her breasts were beautiful! She couldn't help but smile.
She looked down at herself and noticed Sophia's eyes zeroing in on her nipples, which had gotten hard from all the stimulation.
Her heart skipped a beat as Sophia licked her lips before reaching out and stroking her right nipple. Maria reached up and began to play with Sophia's left nipple, while she reached down between her legs to rub her clit.
It didn't take too long for the girls to start getting really hot and heavy, especially after Sophia started fingering her pussy and making her moan. Eventually, they decided it was time to move things upstairs to Maria's bedroom.
Once there, the 2 naked ladies made quick work of undressing each other, getting ready to get down to bidness. But before that could happen, they paused to suck on each others' perky nipples again!
Their warm, wet mouths felt amazing on their sensitive tits, so much so that Sophia quickly got distracted by a sensation that she hadn't experienced in quite some time: she had forgotten how good it felt to have someone suck on her boobs!
This made her giggle as she remembered all the times her ex used to do this for her.
But the thought of her ex no longer interested her now.
Instead, all she could think about was getting Maria to suck on those tits just a bit longer. Soon, Maria finally relented and resumed giving Sophia some serious attention.
But after only a few minutes, Sophia felt an intense desire to breastfeed Maria.
So without warning, she took Maria and cradled her, drawing her closer to those sweet breasts. Maria was surprised by this sudden change of events, but she gladly obliged anyway. As Sophia was getting into her tits being sucked, she felt something leaking from the other tit.
Milk? Was it possible that she was lactating already?!
This was totally unexpected (but quite welcome nonetheless!)
A little while later, Sophia cradled Maria to her other leaky tit, as she gently began to nurse her lover. While doing this, she couldn't help but notice the hungry look on Maria's face, the same look she had been craving ever since she saw her friend for the first time that afternoon.
And soon enough, Maria would experience a new feeling as well...something she'd never even thought about experiencing before. Sucking on her girlfriend's tits made her tingle all over. That's when she realized what this actually was: true love.
The milk flowed, the suckling continued as Sophia cradled Maria tighter and held her head gently against her breast. After a few more minutes of nursing, Sophia gently cradled her friend and embraced her tightly, proceeding to lean in for a kiss.
Maria reciprocated eagerly, almost immediately, as their tongues met and danced in a frenzy of passion. At this moment, the 2 girls realized that what they were feeling wasn't just lust, but love, pure, raw love.
This meant they wanted more than just a quickie.
As the 2 women began exploring each other's bodies, Maria once again looked at Sophia's firm, juicy tits. Even though she was extremely turned on by the sight of them, she still needed more than just Sophia's breasts. And that's when Sophia suggested the idea of Maria going down on her.
Of course, Maria jumped at the chance. Just moments later, she was licking her friend's wet pussy like it was the last thing she'd ever want to do in her life. Her tongue swirled around her clit and stimulated her inner walls. Sophia loved EVERY MINUTE of it.
She bobbed Maria's head up and down, up and down, in circles, in tight little strokes...whatever Maria was doing, Sophia loved it. Every stroke of her tongue felt like heaven on her most sensitive parts.
And after about 5 or 6 minutes of this, Maria got the urge to switch places and have Sophia lie down while she went atop her and put her pussy right near her face. So that's exactly what she did.
Sophia enjoyed having her girl sit on top of her while eating her pussy. But more importantly, she liked the fact that Maria had gotten up close and personal with her clit.
Now, Sophia was licking her clit, sucking on it like a popsicle. The action of it was not only arousing, but also stimulating Maria's whole body as well.
After about 10 minutes of playing with her girlfriend's pussy, Sophia noticed a very different type of reaction happening. Not only was Maria squirming in pleasure, she was also starting to lactate like crazy. The flow of milk from Maria's tits was now getting stronger and thicker!
It also had an added flavor to it, which seemed to make Maria come even harder than before. But it wasn't over yet. Maria wanted more. She needed more. She NEEDED IT!
The 2 girls couldn't resist any longer. They quickly rolled onto their sides and Maria cradled Sophia and began breastfeeding her.
Maria felt like the luckiest chick in the world, being able to get such wonderful attention from her special friend. Sophia latched onto Maria's leaky, engorged tit and began suckling her way to ecstasy.
The action of sucking and licking of Maria's tits felt incredible, making Sophia realize just how great and awesome breastfeeding can feel, especially when you're already horny. All too soon, Maria started feeling that familiar tightening sensation deep within her stomach.
Before long, she was gasping in pleasure as her 2nd orgasm of the day hit her. When it was over, Sophia had a similar experience, still latched onto Maria's tit, milk leaking from her mouth and running down her chin.
This was the most amazing feeling she'd ever felt in her whole life!
After their orgasms subsided, the 2 lovely lasses lay in each other's arms, basking in the afterglow, exchanging kisses and talking with one another. After a few minutes, Maria got up and sat on the edge of the bed.
She then pulled Sophia to her feet and guided her towards the bathroom. Once there, she proceeded to wash Sophia's body. She cleaned her friend's hair and neck, massaged her shoulders and back, and even kissed her gently on the lips and sucked on her tits a bit.
Sophia reciprocated, washing Maria's back and rubbing her body all over her friend's. The duo, still naked, hopped into bed and Maria placed her head on Sophia's chest and wrapped her arm around her best friend.
This is where the night ended, the 2 women falling asleep in each other's arms.
Story 4: Sapphire Sutra
Note: Some kind of interview/chat with your diary thing?
"The name's Alicia. Nothing much to say about myself except that I'm your average 34-year-old Midwest gal."
"What do you do?"
"I'm an amateur journalist. I'm also the writer of a magazine called 'The Reality Factory'."
"The Reality Factory?"
"Yeah, you've probably heard of it. It's a weekly magazine that deals with a wide variety of reality-based subjects. My specialty is interviews, so I usually go out and conduct them. The reality business is a tough one. You need to get the right people for your stories."
"Lemme tell you about this 1 story and this 1 person. The girl's name is Mindy Reynolds. She's 28. Her favorite food is pizza. She likes horror movies. And she likes the same kind of clothes I like."
"How do you know she likes the same clothes you like?"
"Oh, well, cause I well...uh got to know her pretty good. Like, PRETTY GOOD."
"Oh yeah? HOW good?"
"Well, we spent some time together."
"How much time?"
"Well, like a couple days, really."
"Just the 2 of you??"
"Yep. Like, just the 2 us."
"Oh, so you and her were, like, on a date together?"
"Yeah, kinda like that."
"Oooooh, do tell more! I need details, info, c'mon now! Tell me about it!"
"Well, I met her at this convention. I didn't know she was at the convention too."
"Convention?"
"Yeah, the Convention of some random video game and tech stuff. Mindy was attending as a guest and I was just there cause I'm the writer for an article on some of the stuff that was on exhibit. You might know it, it's called, "Strip Minotaur". Cheesy stuff. Well, anyway, I met this hot chick there and we kinda became friends. At first, I didn't know what her job was but I soon found out that she was an amateur filmmaker. And I found out she was also an artist, so she made short movies. Pretty soon, we became best friends and we even started going out."
"She liked you?"
"Oh, yes, I was so flattered when she told me that she liked me. It was the greatest feeling in the world. So, anyway, we went out a few times and she told me that she wanted to take things to the 'next level'. Her words, not mine haha. So we sat down and had a serious talk about it first, and then she told me how much she liked me and how she wanted to go all the way. We talked about a few things first, and then we decided to just go for it."
"What do you mean by 'Go for it'?"
"You know, go to the next level."
"Like, make out?"
"Oh, yeah, we did a lot of makin' out, believe me. She kissed my lips, my ears, and all over my neck. Her tongue felt so good and very VERY sexy. And I loved the feeling of her breasts, and she was real happy to know that I liked them, so she let me play with them and suck on her nipples and kiss them and stuff."
"Wow! Whoa! How far did things get?"
"Well, I think we took things pretty far. Like, you know, we did a little touching, kissing, sucking, licking, everything. We even did a bit of fingering and stuff like that. Mostly over the clothes, but I could feel her pussy gettin' real wet."
"So, you both had sex?"
"Well...eh, not quite, we never actually had full-on sex sex. But we did have some darn good foreplay. Like, we did a bit of oral stuff too. She licked my pussy and sucked on my clit and stuff like that. Of course, I showed her some of that Midwestern charm by lickin' her coochie too."
"Did you finger her?"
"Yeah, a little. We fingered each other for a while. It was pretty hot and it was really kinky."
"Whoa!"
"But my favorite part, oh damn, hmmmmmm, just thinkin' about it makes me wet. My favorite part was when I got to wrap my mouth around her honkers. Those titties were just so gosh darn perfect and they tasted so sweet and so delicious. I just couldn't stop lickin' and suckin' on 'em."
"Honkers?!"
"Yeah, honkers, knockers, jugs, and the million other words for boobs! Anyway, Mindy also liked playin' with my honkers too. In fact, she was the one who was touchin' and suckin' on my knockers first. She said she loved the size and shape of my titties. In her words, 'they were just perfect, Alicia.' Wow, hearing her say that made me feel so--"
"...Amazing?"
"I guess so, yeah. Mindy was a real special gal. There was somethin' different about her. Somethin' special. Somethin'..."
"Sexy?"
"Yeah, she was VERY sexy. Mindy had this air of sexual energy about her. A horny vibe, heh. She always radiated this raw sexual aura, ya know? Every time we touched and kissed, it was like a spark or a shock or somethin' was being sent through our bodies. It was this incredible orgasmic sensation. Every single kiss and every single lick and every single touch was like--like a mini orgasm. And we both couldn't get enough of it."
"Speaking of orgasms, did you? Did she? Did you both?"
"Awww, heck yeah! Many, many times. I lost track of how many orgasms we had. Like, Mindy and I were just makin' out and stuff and then all of a sudden, she started rubbing her pussy and she started moanin' and groanin' and she started cummin'. Like, she just started fingering herself and stuff. It was so darn sexy and so damn hot. Mindy just couldn't control herself. And after she was done, she told me that she was 'just so horny', hehe. And she started rubbin' and suckin' on my honkers again and she told me that she wanted 'to make ME cum too'. And she did. She made me cum many, many, MANY times. We couldn't stop cummin'. Our pussies just couldn't stop gushin' and flowin' and drippin' and stuff. We just couldn't control ourselves. We just kept doin' more and more and more of the same thing."
"More and more of the same thing?"
"Damn right we did! Cuz that worked wonders for us. Mindy and I just couldn't get enough of suckin' and lickin' and touchin' and stuff like that. It was like...the best darn sex I've ever had this side of the Mississippi, hahaha."
"Wow, Mindy sounds like one hell of a gal! And she sounds like one damn horny babe too!"
"She was definitely a damn horny girl. Like, she had a sex drive unlike anyone I've ever seen 'fore. Like, we could be watchin' a movie together and then all of a sudden, Bad-Ta-Doom, out come her clothes and in come her jugs into my mouth, haha. And her nipples, oh my, I couldn't resist suckin' and lovin' on her nipples. They were like the best darn 'candy' I've ever had. They were so soft and juicy and they were just the right amount of sweetness. Not too much, not too little, but just the right amount."
"Hmmm, it sounds like you and Mindy had a damn good time together."
"We did. We had a really darn good time together! It was like a dream. It was so magical and so mystical and it was the most incredible experience of my life. Like, I had NEVER experienced anything like that. Like, ever."
"And you and Mindy are still close?"
"Yes, we are. We talk almost every day."
"So, I take it that the 2 of you are planning on seein' each other again, huh?"
"I hope so. I'd like that very much. But who knows? We live on opposite ends of the country and we're quite busy with our work, so that could be a problem."
"Yeah, that is a problem. But maybe there's a solution. Maybe the 2 of you should get together again, ya know, to do an 'afternoon delight' or a quickie?"
"Ooooooh, yeah, I was thinkin' the same thing! I'd love that more than anythin' in the world! Just to lay my head on Mindy's chest and listen to her heartbeat, or maybe have her suck on my boobies or me lickin' her coochie. Man, I'd give anythin' to spend another gosh darn second with her!"
"Maybe you ought to pick up that phone and dial 'er up."
"Heh, yeah, maybe I oughta, heh."
"So, did you and Mindy have a romantic time together? Did she ever say, 'I love you'?"
"Not that I can remember. But we was having a darn good time and I was havin' a darn good time with her. I feel like I was fallin' in love with her. The way she laughed, the way she smiled, the way she touched me, the way she kissed me, and the way she smelled and the way her skin felt. ALL OF IT! It was so perfect. And, if I was fallin' in love with her, then she was probably fallin' in love with me too. So, I'm hopin' that if the 2 of us do ever meet up again, that we'll get a chance to talk more about 'us', I guess."
"So, what in the hell are you waitin' for, dial 'er up! Give her a ring, Alicia! Call her up, right now! Tell her you wanna meet, do some Netflix and Chill or whatever secret, crazy slang y'all got for sex this week."
"Heh, yeah, I guess I oughta. Thanks for the encouragement."
"No problem."
"Alright, wish me luck, here goes nothin'."
"Close me, put the pen down, and ring her up, goshdangit!"
Story 5: Elena x Kara
Note: stepmom x stepdaughter
"You know, I've never liked her," Kara says, her eyes narrowed as she watches the brunette in the kitchen. "But now that she's my stepmom, it's like she's everywhere."
She types it off and sends it to her best friend, who responds almost instantly, "Oh, you're telling me. My pals are obsessed with her cooking. I can't get a decent meal without thinking of her signature dishes anymore."
"GTFO. I'm forced to eat this stuff every day," Kara grins, rolling her eyes. She couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy at the ease with which her friends seemed to accept her new stepmom, Elena.
The way they raved about her lasagna, her apple pies, and her comforting presence at family gatherings made Kara's skin crawl.
It had been a year since Kara moved into Elena's apartment, and while everyone else had embraced her, Elena (of all people) remained cold, unable to shake off the feeling that Kara was somehow infringing on her sacred space or whatever.
Still, there was something else bubbling beneath the surface of Kara's resentment. Something she couldn't quite put her finger on.
She watches as Elena moves around the kitchen with an elegant grace, her apron tied neatly around her waist.
The smell of roast chicken fills the air, and the clinking of pots and pans creates a rhythm that is oddly soothing despite her irritation.
Kara sighs, deeply and in a frustrated manner, "It's like she's trying to win everyone over," she types furiously into her phone. She can't shake the feeling that Elena's perfection is a façade, a mask hiding some supposed "darker" intent.
Her thumbs hover over the screen, debating whether to share the thought with her friend. Before she can hit send, Elena's voice calls out from the kitchen.
"Oh, Kara, darling, you simply have to try this. C'mere." Elena's voice is sugary sweet Southern belle, a stark contrast to the sourness that had taken root in Kara's thoughts.
She begrudgingly gets up from her bed, the floorboards groaning in protest under her feet, and pads into the kitchen.
Kara rolls her eyes in an exaggerated manner, groaning internally, and walks into the kitchen.
The warmth from the oven hits her like a welcoming embrace, and the aroma of the roast chicken fills her nostrils, making her stomach rumble.
Despite her resentment, she couldn't deny that Elena's cooking was divine. The golden chicken glistened on the serving dish, surrounded by a cornucopia of roasted vegetables. The tantalizing scent made Kara's mouth water, betraying her true feelings.
She hadn't eaten anything the whole day, and the sight of the perfectly roasted chicken made her realize how hungry she is.
She takes the plate Elena offers with a forced smile, trying to ignore the warmth of her stepmother's hand brushing against hers.
"Thank you," she mumbles, retreating to the dining table with the yummies.
Her fork penetrates the tender chicken, the juices seeping into the mashed potatoes below. The 1st bite is heavenly, the flavors dancing in her mouth. Kara can't help but let out a small moan of satisfaction.
Elena's eyes light up with pride from the kitchen island, a smug smile playing on her lips.
Elena smugly and silently returns to her cooking, her movements a dance of precision and grace.
Kara's eyes follow her stepmother, noticing the way the apron strings swayed with her hips and the way her hair was pinned up, exposing her neck in a way that seemed...seductive?
"No!" she anxiously and hurriedly scolds herself, "That's...just your imagination, K."
Just her imagination. Nothing more, right? Elena is Kara's stepmother, for fuck's sake! But why, oh why, did she have to be so...appealing?
It was infuriating.
It IS infuriating!
With her mouth full of food, Kara couldn't help but steal glances at Elena as she moved around the kitchen. The way she stirred the gravy, the curviness of her body, the way she tasted the sauce and pursed her lips...it was all too much.
Kara grunts and takes her plate to her room, unable to ignore the electricity that seemed to crackle in the air between them. She flops onto her bed, the soft mattress enveloping her in a comforting embrace. Her mind races with thoughts of Elena, her stepmother's beauty, and the way her eyes had lingered on her when she took the plate.
The 26-year-old Kara continued to shovel the delicious meal into her mouth, the tension in the air thick enough to cut with a sharp knife. She couldn't shake off the feeling that Elena's touch had lingered on her hand, a phantom sensation that made her palms tingle.
"Goddamn fucking MILF vibes," Kara mutters under her breath, the taste of Elena's cooking lingering on her tongue. She tries to focus on her TV show, but her eyes keep drifting back to the kitchen, watching Elena's silhouette as she tidies up.
Elena is in her early-40s, a woman who's carries herself with grace and poise. Her eyes, a piercing shade of blue, seem to see through Kara's every façade. She's got this air about her, a quiet confidence that Kara can't help but find...alluring?
No, she can't be falling for her freaking stepmom, can she?
A smidgen of sauce dribbles down her chin, and Kara quickly swipes it away, her cheeks flushing with a mix of embarrassment and arousal.
She couldn't believe the thoughts she's having. It's just the stress of the move, she convinced herself. Nothing more.
But the more she tried to rationalize, the more her gaze was drawn back to curvaceous Elena's figure.
Kara tightly swallows the lump of chewed food in her mouth, her thoughts racing. She's absolutely into women, but older women? Her ex-girlfriend's face flashes in her mind, and she can't help but compare her to Elena.
She was a mess, never around when she needed her, never took care of her. Meanwhile, Elena...
Elena has that classic, kind-hearted Southern charm that seems to melt everyone around her. But not Kara. She's the Northern ice queen to Elena's warm embrace, refusing to let her guard down.
Yet, as the months pass, Kara finds it harder to ignore the way her heart skips a beat whenever Elena simply enters the room.
She tries to focus on her unpredictable freelancing gig, her small circle of friends, her hobbies (bracelet making), but the pull is undeniable.
Elena works as a clerk at the local bookstore, and Kara often finds herself there, not for the books, but for the chance to watch her stepmother from a safe distance. She's always dressed so neatly, her blouses tucked into her high-waisted skirts, her glasses perched on her nose as she helps customers with a gentle smile.
It's like watching some kinda live-action romance novel, and Kara is the unwilling protagonist, caught in the plot's steamy embrace.
A week later...
Kara has come down with the flu and the local Southern climate isn't helping (yeehaw). She's laid up in bed, feverish and miserable, when Elena knocks softly on her door.
"Bluuuuurgh," this and many more weird and unpleasant sounds are coming from Kara's throat as she stirs from a deep, feverish sleep. Her eyes crack open, and she's met with a blurry vision of Elena standing over her, a tray of goodies in hand.
"I brought you some chicken noodle soup, darling. It's just what the doctor ordered," Elena says in her ever so soothing voice, setting the tray on the bedside table.
"Hmmmph. Urgh. So...siiiiick. Can't believe this," Kara groans, pushing herself up on her elbows. She feels like a soggy noodle, her body weak and her brain foggy.
Elena sits herself down at the edge of the bed, her hand reaching out to touch Kara's forehead. The coolness of her skin feels like heaven against the burning heat of Kara's fever, "Aww, you poor thing," she says, her voice full of genuine concern.
Kara callously swats the caring hand away, and looks to the side, embarrassed and frustrated by her own body's betrayal, "I'm fine," she mumbles, trying to keep her voice steady, but it cracks under the weight of her sickness.
Elena presses her lips into a tight line and shakes her head from side to side, "You're not fine, Kara. You're burning up," she says with a gentle yet firm tone.
She scoops a spoonful of the steaming soup and brings it to Kara's mouth, ignoring the blonde's weak protests.
Kara moues and clicks her tongue, but the scent of chicken soup fills her nostrils, and her stomach growls. She can't resist, and she takes the spoon from Elena's hand, sipping the hot broth greedily. It's heavenly, and she can feel the warmth spreading through her body, battling the wretched fever.
Elena gently coos like a nurse, her hand supporting the back of Kara's neck as she feeds her another spoonful of the soul-soothing soup. Kara's eyes flutter closed as the warmth spreads through her body, soothing the aches and pains brought on by the dreaded flu.
Kara holds her hand up and asks for a few seconds to breathe. She can feel the warmth of Elena's hand through her hair, and it sends a shiver down her spine, "Thanks," she whispers, her voice hoarse.
"Of course, darling. Just cuz you're my stepdaughter don't mean you're not still my friend," Elena says with a smile, her eyes filled with genuine care.
Kara's throat tightens as she feels the weight of Elena's words. She's never had anyone take care of her like this, not in a long-ass time.
They sit there in silence for a few moments, the only sound being the clinking of the spoon against the porcelain bowl. Kara's eyes drift over to Elena's hand, her fingers long and slender, and she can't help but imagine them running over her own body, bringing her comfort in a way that's of a different kind.
Still, in her current state, Kara would just pass on the nasties to Elena, and she'd pass it on to everyone else in turn, "No, no, you should go," Kara says, her voice cracking. "I don't want you to get sick too."
Elena clicks her tongue. "Tsk, tsk. I've been 'round worse, Kara. It's the flu, as long as you get your vaccines and some rest, you'll be right as rain," she says, her Southern drawl wrapping around the words like a warm blanket.
She takes the spoon and continues to feed Kara, her gaze never leaving her.
For a split second, Kara's bleary eyes fall down to Elena's cleavage that's peeking out from her loosely buttoned blouse. She quickly looks away, feigning a cough to cover her blush, "I appreciate it," she murmurs, the spoonful of soup slipping down her throat like a warm, liquid embrace.
"See something you like?" Elena asks playfully, noticing Kara's eyes dart away.
Kara's cheeks flush hotter than the soup she's consuming. She's not sure if it's the fever or her stepmother's teasing tone that's setting her on fire.
Kara stammers and struggles to formulate a response, her heart hammering in her chest, "It's just...the light," she says, trying to play it off, her eyes avoiding Elena's knowing gaze.
Elena is no gosh darn fool. She sees the way Kara's eyes dart away and the pink that floods her cheeks. She knows what that look means.
But she's a woman of patience, a tender-hearted hunter of hearts. She'll bide her time.
A naughty smirk forms on her face as she dips the spoon into the soup again, bringing it to Kara's eager lips, "Eat up, darling. You need your strength," she says, her voice dripping with double meaning.
Kara's quavering lips part to accept the next spoonful, her eyes unable to resist meeting Elena's. They're so close, Kara can feel Elena's warm breath on her face, smell the faint scent of her lavender perfume mixed with the aroma of the soup.
She takes a deep breath, her chest tightening with an unexpected yearning. The moment stretches out, the air thick with something that feels suspiciously like desire.
Elena sniffs the air, her smile widening as she takes in the scent of Kara's feverish arousal, a faint hint of sweat and mint, "I think I've got just the thing for that," she says, her voice dropping to a whisper.
She sets the soup aside and reaches into her pocket, pulling out a small bottle of perfume.
Elena calmly asks her stepdaughter to hold out her wrist, and Kara complies, her pulse racing as Elena dabs a bit of the perfume onto her skin.
She brings it closer to her nose and takes a deep breath, the sweet scent filling her senses and mixing with the comforting aroma of the soup, "It's...it's nice," Kara manages to say, her voice a mere whisper.
"I made it myself," Elena says, her voice beaming with a certain sense of pride and accomplishment, "It's a blend of lavender and vanilla. I find it quite calming."
Kara musters a smile, trying to ignore the way her body responds to Elena's nearness. She can feel the warmth from Elena's hand as it lingers on her wrist, and she has to fight the urge to lean into her stepmother's touch. It's like a moth to a flame, sort of.
Even if either of them wanted so badly to act on their burningly-passionate desires, the sickness was a clear barrier.
Elena knows it isn't the right time. Not now, hun.
With a sigh, she pulls back her hand and stands up, "Alright, darling. I'll let you rest. Call me if you need anything," she says, her voice still holding a hint of the seductive tease.
Kara weakly nods and reaches for her phone as Elena exits the room. Her heart thuds against her chest, a confusing mix of emotions swirling inside her. She tries to push the thoughts away, focusing on the TV show playing in the background, but the silence is deafening.
She can still feel the ghost of Elena's touch on her forehead and her wrist.
She texts her friend again, trying to shake off the unsettling feelings: "What do you think of Elena?" Kara writes, her thumbs moving sluggishly over the screen.
The response comes back almost immediately: "What's to think? She's cool. Hot stepmom vibes, obviously."
"Yeah, about that...I think I might be catching some weird feels," Kara types out, her thumbs moving a little too fast for her own comfort. She hits send before she can take it back, her heart racing faster than the blinking cursor.
":-O what the actual fuck?!" her friend's texted response pops up on Kara's screen: "You're not supposed to get those feels for your stepmom. That's like...uh idk what to say omg lol wtf all that."
Kara's thumbs hover over the phone, contemplating a snappy comeback, but she can't deny the truth of the statement. She sighs, setting the phone aside and staring at the wall.
She blows a raspberry and tosses her phone aside, her thoughts racing. This isn't happening. She can't be attracted to Elena, right? It's just the sickness messing with her head. But the feeling is persistent, like a firefly buzzing around her.
Elena is at the dining table, a mixed look of amusement and curiosity playing on her face as she reads a romantic fantasy novel.
Kara, feeling slightly better, emerges from her room wearing an oversized tee that clings to her dampened body. She's lost her appetite for everything but the woman before her.
The sight of Elena's plump lips moving as she reads sends a shiver down her spine. Elena thumbs through the pages, her eyes glued to the book. Kara's stomach turns with a mix of hunger and desire, and she tries to convince herself it's just the flu messing with her.
But she can't ignore the way Elena's legs are crossed, the fabric of her skirt riding up just enough to show off the top of her thighs.
Kara licks her lips and takes a few shaky steps towards the kitchen, her eyes never leaving Elena's voluptuous figure. She pours herself a glass of water, the condensation running down the side and pooling onto the counter. Her hand shakes slightly as she brings the glass to her mouth, her eyes straying back to Elena.
Elena can feel her stepdaughter's lustful gaze on her, and she can't help but smirk to herself. She's seen it before, the way women look at her when they're interested. But this...this is new and uncharted territory. She's never had the hots for someone she's supposed to think of as "family".
She pipes up, "Somethin' I can do for you, darlin'?" Oh, that damn sweet seductive Southern drawl. It's like it's designed to make Kara's knees weak, and her knees are already plenty weak thanks to the flu.
Kara nervously spits out a lie, "N--no, I just needed water." She tries to keep her voice steady, but it's shaking almost as much as her hand holding the glass. She takes a deep gulp, the cool liquid soothing her dry throat but not her racing thoughts. She tries to tear her gaze away from Elena, but it's like her eyes are magnetically drawn to her stepmother's curvy curves.
Elena loudly reads out a random line from her romantasy novel, her voice dripping with sarcasm, "Ah, the heroine's about to make love. How utterly original," she says, not looking up from the page.
Kara's eyes widen at this sudden outburst, and she can't help but laugh. It's a welcome sound, breaking the tension in the room like a pin to a balloon, "You read that stuff?" she asks, her voice still hoarse from the sickness but laced with curiosity.
"'Course I do. Everyone needs a hobby. I know you like your bracelet making and I have a thing for cheesy sapphic erotica," Elena says with a wink, "It's like watching a bad rom-com. You know it's terrible, but you can't stop watching."
Kara mutters under her breath, "Or a porno from Mommy's Girl."
She couldn't help but feel a bit exposed, "Yeah, well, everyone needs a guilty pleasure." She tries to play it cool, but the heat from her cheeks gives her away.
"Hmm, what was that?" Elena's head snaps up from her book, a knowing smile playing on her lips. She's caught Kara off guard, and she loves it, "You OK, darlin'?" she asks, her eyes glinting with mischief.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go back and rest," Kara says, trying to sound nonchalant as she sets the empty glass down. She turns to leave, her heart hammering in her chest like a drumline at a football game.
"Get well soon! And maybe, just maybe, I'll let you borrow 1 of my books," Elena calls after Kara, her smile lingering like a secret between them.
Kara likes watching her porn, not reading through it like some kind of Victorian-era type, but she keeps that little tidbit to herself. She mumbles something about being tired and shuffles back to her room, the door clicking shut with finality.
She throws her limp and weak body onto her bed, the comforter a lifeless mountain she must conquer. Her phone buzzes again.
Her friend's response to her confession is a series of laughing emojis followed by a flurry of questions and exclamation marks: "You're so full of shit. PLZ Tell me more," it reads.
"Srsly getting like Niagara Falls whenever I'm around her, ngl, it's weird," Kara texts back, her thumbs moving with surprising agility despite her weakened state. She can feel the heat rising in her cheeks again, her body responding to the mere thought of Elena's touch.
"I'm also feeling like Niagara Falls down there just imagining it," her friend responds with a winky face. Kara's cheeks burn with a blend of embarrassment and...something else.
She's not sure if it's the fever or the conversation, but she can't deny the thrill that runs through her body.
To taste of the fruit forbidden, to feel the heat of a passion that should not be, it's a dance that plays out in Kara's mind every time she's around Elena. And today, with her defenses down thanks to the flu, the dance is more intense than ever.
"I imagine what it'd be like to suck on Elena's perkies," Kara's friend sends back, her text bubbles popping up with a mischievous glint.
Kara's phone vibrates against her thigh, and she hastily moves it away, as if the device itself is a hot coal that could burn her.
Kara lazily responds with a series of face palm emojis, trying to ignore the sudden ache between her legs. She flops back onto her pillows, her thoughts racing. She's never felt this way about a "family member", especially not one who's taken on the role of stepmother. It's wrong, right? But it feels so...right?
72 hours later...
Kara is all well and no more sick after 3 whole days of Elena's meticulous, tender, and loving care. The fever has broken, the cough has ceased, and she's back to her usual self- well, almost. The lingering ache between her legs hasn't disappeared with her illness, and she can't shake the memory of Elena's gentle ministrations.
She's doing some amateur pilates in her room, sweat trickling down her neck, when Elena knocks and enters without waiting for a response, "You should be taking it easy, darlin'. You're not fully recovered yet," Elena says, her eyes taking in Kara's form-fitting workout clothes, her chest heaving with exertion.
A bit of Kara's cleavage peeks out from her sports bra as she sits up, a bead of sweat rolling down her collarbone.
She can't help but feel a little self-conscious under Elena's gaze, her nipples hardening at the thought of her stepmother watching her, "I'm fine, really. I just needed to get some energy out," she says, trying to keep her voice steady.
Elena is wearing a sharp suit and a pencil skirt that hugs her curves, looking like a saleswoman ready to close some deals and shit. She walks over to Kara, placing a hand on her shoulder, "Why don't you take it easy and watch a movie instead?" she suggests, her eyes scanning Kara's body.
Kara blinks the sweat out of her eyes, her breath coming in ragged gasps, "I'm OK, really," she insists, though her body seems to disagree as it trembles slightly under Elena's gentle touch. She can't deny the comfort it brings, though, and the warmth spreads through her like a balm.
She proceeds to ask her stepmom where she is going, dressed like that, "Who are you suing?" Kara's voice is a mix of curiosity and something else, something she can't quite put her finger on.
Elena heartily laughs at her stepdaughter's question, "Sue someone? Oh, darlin', I'm just going to work at the bookstore. Dressing up makes me feel professional," she says, her eyes sparkling with a hint of something that makes Kara's heart skip a beat.
She takes a deep breath, trying to ignore the scent of Elena's perfume that lingers in the air, reminding her of the intimate moments they shared during her illness.
"What do you have to watch around here, anyway?" Elena asks, her eyes lingering on Kara's lovely (albeit sweaty) figure, "I know you've got those fancy streaming services," she says, her voice dropping to a purr.
Kara's stomach does a little flip-flop, and she wonders if Elena knows more than she's letting on.
"Um...I was binging Season 2 of The White Lotus," Kara replies, hoping her cheeks aren't giving away the full spectrum of her blush.
She quickly wipes her forehead with the back of her hand, trying to play it cool, "But I could always use some watch company."
Elena exclaims, "Oh, I've been meaning to finish the 1st Season! I heard it's quite the drama." Her eyes twinkle as she suggests, "Why don't we watch it together?" The proposal hangs in the air, thick with unspoken tension.
Kara shrugs, trying to act nonchalant, "Sure, why not?" She grabs a towel to wipe down her neck and chest, her heart racing like it's doing intense cardio. She's not sure if she's ready to be in such close proximity to Elena again, especially after their charged interactions during her sickness.
Elena smiles and prepares to head out to the bookstore, leaving Kara in the living room, surrounded by the faint scent of her homemade soup. The TV's on, and Kara's about to start watching some random cooking thing when she hears the front door open and close.
She takes a deep breath, trying to shake off the weird feelings that have been clinging to her like a sticky cobweb since Elena started taking care of her.
She begins to text her close friend about the awkwardness of the situation, but the words don't come out right. Her thoughts are a jumble of "What the fuck?!" and "What if she...?" and "Oh god, what if she doesn't!?" She sends a string of question marks instead, her thumb hovering over the send button.
Her friend texts back with a longer string of question marks followed by some very suggestive emojis.
Kara rolls her eyes but can't help the smile that forms. It's nice to have someone to confide in, even if she's being ridiculous. She sends back a quick message, saying she's going to watch TV and forget about it, then tosses her phone onto the couch cushion.
The phone vibrates and Kara's eyes dart over to it, a mix of excitement and dread. What if Elena had changed her mind? What if she didn't want to come back?
But the text is from her friend, not Elena: "Oh, come on, you know you want it. Just go for it gurl," it reads, followed by a winking emoji and a few peaches.
Kara sighs and picks up the remote, clicking through the channels.
Hours pass, as Kara goes from TV to phone to TV again, the room a silent testament to her indecision. The sun dips below the horizon, and the house is bathed in a warm, orange glow that seems to highlight every crevice and curve of Elena's absence.
Kara's about to give up hope when she hears the sound of the door opening, and the click of high heels echoing through the hallway.
Elena cheerfully announces her return. She's holding a brown grocery bag, the smell of freshly baked bread wafting in from outside, "Look what I brought back!" she says, her eyes meeting Kara's with a knowing glint.
Kara's stomach rumbles, but it's not just hunger for food.
It's hunger for pussy.
Kara suppresses those urges and offers to take the filled bag from Elena's arms, "Let me help," she says, her voice a little too eager. Elena's eyes sparkle as she lets Kara take the bag, their hands brushing together, sending a jolt of electricity through Kara's body.
Elena says that the grocery store had some good discounts on baked goodies, veggies, and all that stuff. Kara follows Elena into the kitchen, her eyes drawn to the sway of her hips in the tight skirt.
"What's the movie?" Elena asks, her voice light and airy, as if the heaviness in the room isn't suffocating them both.
Kara stammers. "Uh...I was just absentmindedly flipping channels or scrolling through my phone while you were out, so nothing's started yet," she admits, her cheeks reddening. She feels like a person with a crush who's been caught red-handed.
Elena runs her hands down her curvaceous body, as if wiping some invisible dust, "Well, we can't have that, can we?"
She grins and adds, "Let's pick something fun, something that'll make us laugh," she suggests, her eyes flickering to Kara's flustered face before heading to the TV.
Kara almost chokes on her own spit as she watches Elena approach the TV, her hips swaying with a grace that seems almost otherworldly, "L--Laughing sounds good," she manages to croak out, her mind racing with images that have nothing to do with comedy.
And more to do with eroticism and romance.
She sheepishly makes her way to the living room and sits on the single-seat sofa.
Elena moues in disapproval, "Oh, Kara, darling, you can't sit all the way over there by your lonesome. You're not giving us enough snuggle space," she says, patting the couch next to her. Kara's heart does a little dance of dread and anticipation.
"I--I'm fine here, honest."
Elena clicks her tongue, "Come now, are you still worried that you're gonna pass the flu onto your step mommy?" she teases, a knowing smile playing on her lips.
Kara gulps, her heart racing, "It's just...I don't want to get you sick," she says weakly.
"I'm vaccinated against the darn thing and so are you, darlin'. Besides, I'm a strong gal," Elena says, her voice like honey. She sashays over to the single sofa and sits down on the armrest, her leg brushing against Kara's. The heat from her body is palpable, and Kara can't ignore it anymore.
Kara's eyes go over to Elena's breasts and she can't help but wonder what's under that suit jacket, "So, what's the plan for tonight?" Kara asks, trying to keep the conversation as casual as possible.
"I believe the younger generation calls it 'Chill and Netflix' or something to that effect."
Kara almost gags and laughs at Elena's attempt to be hip. "OK, 'Chill and Netflix' it is," she says, her voice a mix of amusement and nerves. She tries to act cool, but her heart is racing like fucking Speed Racer on speed.
Kara finally concedes and joins her beloved stepmother on the big couch, their legs tangling together as Elena takes charge of the TV remote. The room is suffused with the warmth of Elena's presence, and Kara can't ignore the way her skin tingles where they touch.
She tries to focus on the TV screen, but her eyes keep darting over to Elena, who seems utterly oblivious to the turmoil brewing inside her.
Or does she know, and is she simply playing coy?
A random documentary seems to be airing on the TV, but neither of them pay much attention to it. Kara's eyes are glued to Elena's boobs, her mind racing with thoughts she's not ready to admit aloud. Elena pays attention to the documentary, but her eyes do sneak peaks at Kara's bare legs.
In the middle of a commercial break, Elena casually asks, "So, Kara, how long have you been doing this workout thing for? You do seem pretty...flexible," she says it with a sly smile, her eyes sliding down Kara's legs and back up to her chest.
Kara swallows the lump forming in her throat, "Oh, um...for about 18 months now. Yeah, it's something I do to keep fit and all the usual jazz."
Elena is genuinely impressed by her stepdaughter's commitment to fitness, "You're doing a great job," she says, her eyes lingering on the way Kara's sweatpants hug her toned thighs.
"You know, I used to be quite the Jane Fonda enthusiast," she adds, her voice taking on a nostalgic lilt, "But work took over, and I had to prioritize."
Kara awkwardly laughs along, "Yeah, cool, cool." She's trying so hard to keep her composure, but it's like trying to keep a beach ball underwater. It's just not fuckin' happening.
Elena unbuttons the top buttons of her shirt and arches her back to stretch, her ample cleavage peeking out. Kara can't help but stare, her eyes drawn to those inviting mounds like a moth to a flame. The room feels hot, and it's not just because of the Southern heat.
Kara clears her throat and tries anything to distract herself, focusing on the TV. The documentary has moved on to something about honeybees, but she can't for the life of her remember what it's about. Her eyes flick back to Elena's chest, the way the fabric stretches taut over her breasts.
Elena remarks on the TV show, "These little buzzers are fascinating, aren't they? So much to learn from their social structure."
Kara nods, trying to follow the conversation while her mind is a raging battleground of lust and confusion.
Suddenly, Elena says, "My goodness, it's so hot in here! This time of year always gets to me," as she fans herself with a magazine.
She stands up, her skirt hugging her hips as she moves to the thermostat. The sight of her standing there, in her tight skirt, is like a siren's call to Kara.
Kara licks her lips as Elena adjusts the thermostat to something more comfortable. The air in the room feels charged with a tension that's palpable, and Kara can't ignore the way her skin prickles with anticipation. She tries to keep her eyes on the TV, but they keep straying back to Elena's curvy body, her mind playing out scenes she's convinced she shouldn't be thinking about.
Elena says she's going to the bathroom for a quick spritz of cold water, "Do you need anything?" she asks over her shoulder, her skirt riding up slightly as she walks away, revealing the lacy band of her panties.
Kara shakes her head, unable to form words.
Instead, she seizes on this moment to text her close friend about how hot Elena is and how she can't stop thinking about her: "What the fuck is happening to me?" she types out, her thumbs moving with the speed of sound itself.
Her friend's response is quick and to the point: "You're crushing on your stepmom. It's wild, but hey, you're not the 1st and u won't be the last."
"TF should i do about it?!" Kara texts back, her thumbs flying over the screen as she tries to make sense of her feelings. She can still feel the warmth from where Elena's leg had been pressed against hers.
"Act on it ;-) or be a prude and let that sweet, tasty cougar pussy pass you by. Hell, if she's available, send her my digits, I'd looooove me some cougar action," her friend texts back, complete with a drooling emoji.
Kara's cheeks burn with a mix of embarrassment and...desire?
"Act on it? are u smoking pot again?! how should i even initiate such a thing?! she's my stepmom!" Kara types back in a hurry, her heart racing like it's in a marathon. She can't believe she's even considering this.
"Just...like, idk, peck her on the cheek or something. Like how they do in those Mommy's Girl vids u love sending me," her friend texts, the words hitting Kara like a sledgehammer.
She looks at the TV, the documentary playing out scenes of bees doing their thing, and feels the heat of Elena's touch still lingering on her shoulder.
Kara shakily lets out a laugh, dropping her phone onto the couch cushion. She's never felt so torn apart by desire and disbelief. But as she looks around the room, she knows she can't keep this to herself much longer. She needs advice, guidance, something to navigate these interesting waters.
Elena walks back in, humming some tune from the 1990s, her skirt swaying with every step. She's holding an ice cube in her hand, which she runs down the side of her neck, her eyes flickering to Kara as she does so, "Much better," she says with a sigh, the cold droplets of water tracing a path down her exposed cleavage.
She plumps herself down next to Kara, her leg brushing against hers again. Kara tries not to react, but the electricity between them feels like a live wire. She shifts in her seat, the fabric of her sweatpants sticking to her skin, her heart racing like a Formula 1 car on the last lap.
Elena simply asks, "So, what'd I miss?"
Her eyes are sparkling with mischief as she settles into the couch cushions. Kara's mind is racing with all the ways she could interpret that question, but she sticks to the safe bet.
"Uh...I haven't been paying much attention. I was uh...um...thinking," Kara stammers, her eyes darting back to the TV screen, desperately trying to focus on the bees.
Elena looks concerned, "Thinking? About what, darling? You know that you can come to your step mommy about anything," she says, her hand reaching out to gently pat Kara's leg. The warmth of her touch sends a shiver down Kara's spine.
"Any--anything? Like, literally anything?" Kara's voice is shakier than a leaf in a tornado, her leg jerking slightly under Elena's touch. She's about to spill the beans about her feelings, but she chickens out, her mouth going dry.
Elena musses Kara's hair around her fingers, her eyes never leaving the TV, "Kara, honey, you know you can talk to me about anything. I'm here for you," she says, her voice a gentle reminder of the bond that's been growing between them.
"Any--anything? Right, are--are you sure?"
Elena is as patient as ever, her eyes still glued to the TV, "Of course, darling. You know that. We're family now," she says, her voice soothing like a warm cup of tea on a rainy day.
Kara feels like she's about to burst like a piñata at a birthday party.
Kara gulps and turns to face Elena, her heart pounding in her chest, "There's something I...I need to tell you," she whispers, her voice trembling with anticipation.
Elena's eyes finally leave the TV screen and meet hers, full of curiosity and concern.
"Of course, dear. Go on. I'm all ears, Kara. What's been bothering you?" Elena's voice is like a warm summer breeze, caressing Kara's nerves and calming her racing thoughts.
"I like you. Like, really like you," Kara blurts out, her face on fire.
Elena's eyes widen, a smile playing at the corners of her lips as she takes in the earnestness of Kara's confession.
"Is that so?" she asks, her voice teasing and light, a playful glint in her eye, "How do you 'like' me, Kara?" She leans in, her breath hot against Kara's cheek, and Kara feels like she's going to faint.
Kara moves away from Elena slightly, her eyes darting around the room, "I mean, like...LIKE you, ya know," she clarifies, her voice barely a murmur. The silence stretches out like a tightrope between them, and Kara feels like she's about to fall.
Elena, for her part, calmly takes a moment to digest Kara's words, her eyes never leaving Kara's flushed face.
She reaches for the TV remote and turns off the documentary, the sudden silence amplifying the thump of Kara's racing heart, "Kara, sweetheart," she begins, her voice low and velvety, "You're my stepdaughter, and I will always care for you deeply..." she trails off, searching for the right words.
Kara fills in the tense silence by blurting out, "It's just that you're...you're so beautiful and kind, and...and I just can't help the way I feel," her voice trembling like a leaf in a storm.
Elena's smile fades, and she looks at Kara with a softness that makes her heart flutter like a bird in a cage.
"Since when did you...harbor these feelings?" Elena's voice is gentle, her gaze piercing into Kara's being. Kara feels like she's under a microscope, but she can't lie. Not anymore.
"A few months since I moved back into your apartment. I was just so overwhelmed by your kindness, your hospitality, your...everything," Kara confesses, her eyes searching Elena's for any sign of what she might be thinking.
Elena's hand is still resting on her leg, the heat of it a comfort and a torment at the same time.
Elena narrows her eyes in thought, her hand still resting on Kara's leg, "A few months, you say?" Her voice is a purr, and Kara can't help but nod, feeling like a rabbit caught in a wolf's gaze, "And why haven't you told me sooner?"
"Because!" Kara squeaks out, her heart hammering in her chest like a drumline, "I didn't know how you'd react, and I didn't want to ruin things and get fuckin' kicked out for being some kinda weirdo," she says, her voice shaking.
Elena gently strokes Kara's cheek, her thumb making small circles that send shockwaves of pleasure up her spine, "You think I'd kick you out for having feelings?" she asks, her voice a soft caress.
Kara's breath hitches in her throat as she looks into Elena's eyes, searching for the truth.
"Uh...yeah. I mean, it's pretty intense, right? You're my stepmom, right?" Kara murmurs, her eyes darting away from Elena's gaze.
Elena continues affectionately stroking Kara's cheek, her thumb tracing the line of her jaw, "Kara, I've noticed the way you look at me, the way you react to my touch. I've felt the tension growing between us," she confesses, her eyes dark with something that could be desire.
Kara's breath catches in her throat, her heart racing so fast it feels like it might just pop out of her chest.
For a moment, Elena's expression turns introspective, "To be honest, I've had feelings for you too," she says softly, "But I didn't want to make things awkward. You've always been so...resistant to me, I didn't think you'd be open to this."
Kara's eyes widen in surprise, "You have?" she whispers, her voice barely audible.
Elena nods, her gaze never leaving Kara's, "Since you moved back in, I've noticed how...cold you are. How hostile you seem towards me. I thought maybe I did something wrong, or you just didn't like me," she says, her voice filled with a hint of sadness.
Kara doesn't know how to reply to Elena's admission. Her mind is a tornado of emotions- surprise, excitement, and a touch of fear. But before she can say anything, Elena leans in, and their lips meet in a soft, tentative kiss.
It's like the moment before a storm breaks, a mix of anticipation and relief. Kara's eyes flutter shut, and she lets herself lean into the warmth of Elena's embrace.
Elena breaks it off and looks away, a hint of pink tinting her cheeks, "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that," she says, her voice barely a whisper.
But Kara can't let it end there. She won't. Her hand shoots out and grabs Elena's, pulling her back in for another kiss, this one more urgent and hungry.
Before going in for the kiss, Kara says, "I--I'm sorry if I hurt you in any way or if I was mean or rude or...I just didn't know how to deal with these feelings," her voice a mix of apology and desire.
Elena purrs against Kara's lips, her hand coming up to cup Kara's cheek, guiding her back in for another kiss. This time, there's no hesitation. Their mouths move together in a dance of passion and discovery, tongues brushing against each other, exploring and tasting.
Kara feels a shiver of excitement run down her spine, her body responding to Elena's touch like it's been waiting for this moment for a freaking lifetime.
Moans of passion fill the room, drowning out the distant hum of the TV, as their kiss grew more intense, more demanding. Kara's hands find their way under Elena's shirt, caressing the warm, soft skin of her back.
Elena's own hands had wander to Kara's waist, pulling her closer, her thumbs tracing the line of Kara's waistband, teasing the sensitive skin just above the fabric.
Tongues continue to dance together, exploring the depths of each other's mouths, as Kara's hands grew bolder. She slides them up Elena's back, feeling the firmness of her toned physique beneath the fabric. Elena's breath hitched, her own hands slipping down to grip Kara's hips, pulling their bodies into a tight embrace.
The scent of Elena's perfume filled the air, intoxicating Kara even further.
Their kisses grow more tender, more passionate. Elena's thumbs caressed Kara's cheeks, her eyes fluttering shut in pleasure. Kara could feel Elena's heart beating against her chest, a rapid rhythm that matched her own. They pulled away for a moment, panting, their eyes locking in a silent conversation of longing and need.
Kara heaves in lungs full of air, her heart racing as Elena's thumbs graze her cheekbones. She feels a mix of shock and exhilaration, her body humming with a newfound energy. Elena's eyes bore into hers, the warmth and affection unmistakable, and she leans in again, their lips pressing together in a passionate embrace that sends sparks flying all over the place!
Their kisses become deeper, more exploratory. The tip of Elena's tongue traces the outline of Kara's lips before delving into her mouth, and Kara responds with equal fervor, her hands gripping Elena's shoulders tightly. They're lost in a whirlwind of passion, their bodies moving together in a silent but horny symphony of desire.
"Mmmmmmmmmm. Kara," Elena murmurs, her voice a sultry whisper against Kara's skin. Kara's eyes are closed, savoring the sweet taste of Elena's lips, the gentle pressure of Elena's body against hers. Her hands slide up Elena's back, feeling the heat of her skin, the tension of her muscles.
"Mommy...I need you," Kara whispers into Elena's ear, the words slipping out before she can even think to stop them.
Elena's eyes widen for a moment before she smiles, the mischief in her gaze unmistakable.
Elena huskily growls, "And I need you too," her breath hot and sweet against Kara's skin. She stands, her skirt flaring around her legs as she pulls Kara up with her. Kara's knees wobble like jelly, but she follows, drawn to Elena like a magnet to metal.
They go to the main bedroom, the air thick with anticipation. Elena's hand is firm on the small of Kara's back, guiding her through the apartment as if navigating a complicated dance floor. The bedroom door clicks shut behind them, and Kara's heart feels like it's going to jump out of her chest. The room is dimly lit, the curtains drawn closed.
Elena deftly slips out of her skirt, revealing a matching lacy thong and bra set that perfectly frames her luscious curves.
Kara's eyes widen in awe, unable to believe what's happening. She feels a mix of excitement and anxiety, her hands trembling as they trace the waistband of her own sweatpants.
She struggles to get them off, her body trembling with excitement. Elena takes over, her fingers adeptly untying the drawstring and sliding the fabric down Kara's legs, revealing the panty she's been wearing all evening. The sight of Kara's bare skin sends a jolt of electricity through Elena, her eyes darkening with desire.
Elena bites her lower lip, "A blue panty, huh? Blue...is my favorite color, darlin'." She smirks, her eyes sparkling with mischief. She steps closer to Kara, their bodies almost touching. The room feels smaller, the air hotter, as the anticipation builds.
Kara sheepishly asks, "C--Can I unbutton your shirt a--and rem--remove it?" Her voice is shaky, her breaths shallow, but her eyes never leave Elena's.
Elena nods, her smile growing wider, and steps closer, allowing Kara to fumble with the buttons. As the fabric falls away, Kara gasps at the sight of Elena's full, round breasts, barely contained by her lacy purple bra.
Kara licks her lips and cups those tempting titties with trembling hands, feeling the weight and warmth of Elena's breasts. She leans in to kiss Elena's neck, her breath hot and erratic, as Elena's head tilts back in pleasure. The fabric of the bra gives way easily, and Kara's mouth waters as she sees Elena's hard nipples peeking out at her.
Elena whispers, her voice a seductive purr, "Why don't you...suck on them, hmm?"
The words hang in the air like a dare, sending a shock of excitement through Kara's body. She doesn't need to be told twice! She drops to her knees, her heart hammering in her chest, and takes 1 of those perfect, pink(ish) tips into her watering mouth.
Elena places her hand behind Kara's head and gently nudges her, a low moan escaping her lips as Kara eagerly laps at her nipple, her tongue swirling around the sensitive bud. The feeling is heavenly, sending waves of pleasure through Elena's body, making her knees go weak.
Kara continues sucking on Elena's nipple, her enthusiasm growing with every second that passes. Elena's hand in her hair is gentle but firm, guiding her, teaching her how to pleasure her.
Kara's tongue flicks and swirls, her teeth grazing the sensitive skin, eliciting gasps and moans from Elena's lips. She feels a powerful sense of satisfaction, knowing she's the one causing these sounds of pleasure.
"Aaaaaah, yeah, oh, y--yeah, suck on 'em, Kara, suck 'em like that!" Elena moans, her hand tightening in Kara's hair. Her breathing is heavy, and her body sways slightly as Kara eagerly follows her instructions. Kara's never felt so alive, so wanted. She switches to the other nipple, feeling it stiffen under her tongue, and Elena's hand moves from her head to her shoulder, gripping tightly.
Kara puckers her lips and sucks harder, her cheeks hollowing as she takes Elena's nipple into her mouth, feeling it grow even stiffer. She runs her hands up Elena's legs, feeling the smoothness of her thighs, and finally reaches the apex of her desires- the damp warmth of her panties.
"It's wetter than a swamp down here, Elena," Kara murmurs, her voice thick with desire as her hand hovered over the lacy barrier.
Elena chuckles, her eyes half-lidded with lust, "Then why don't you find out just how wet it is?" she replies, her voice a challenge.
Kara bites her lips in anticipation and quickly pulls down her stepmom's panties, revealing a glistening pussy that's clearly eager for her mouth. The sweet scent of arousal fills the air, making Kara's stomach flip-flop. She's never felt so nervous and turned on at the same time.
She runs her fingers through Elena's folds, feeling the slickness and heat of her desire.
Kara looks up at her beloved stepmother with a mix of trepidation and excitement. She's never done this before- not with someone so close. But Elena's eyes are filled with encouragement and lust, urging her forward. She leans in, her breath hot and heavy, and kisses Elena's vagina with a gentle peck, feeling the softness of her skin against her lips.
She kisses that sweet spot again and again, her heart racing as Elena's thighs part wider for her, giving her more access. The older woman's hand is still tangled in her stepdaughter's hair, but now it's guiding Kara's face closer to her center.
Kara's tongue darts out, licking the wetness from Elena's labia, the taste of her stepmother's desire sending a bolt of lightning straight to her own pussy.
Elena's moans grow louder, more demanding, and Kara's confidence skyrockets. She runs her tongue along the length of Elena's slit, savoring every inch, every shiver of pleasure that runs through her stepmother's body. Her hands move to hold Elena's thighs, steadying herself as she dives deeper into this newfound world of pleasure.
Kara's tongue swirls and darts, teasing Elena's clit, feeling it swell and pulse under her touch. She's like a student eagerly learning from the most tempting teacher, her eyes never leaving Elena's face, watching for every sign of what she's doing right.
Kara's eyes are wide with excitement and trepidation as she licks and kisses Elena's pussy, her shakiness only adding to the thrill of the moment. She's eager to learn, eager to pleasure Elena in ways she never thought possible, and with each moan and gasp that escapes Elena's lips, she feels a sense of achievement and progress.
Elena looks down and locks eyes with Kara, her pupils dilated with desire, "Keep going, keep...going," she whispers, her voice hoarse with passion.
Kara nods eagerly, her tongue delving deeper into Elena's warm, wet folds. She flicks and circles Elena's clit with the tip of her tongue, the sensation driving her stepmother wild.
"AAAAAAH! Oh, oh, oh...yeah, oh, oh...right there," Elena's breathy voice echoes through the room as Kara's tongue continues to dance around her clit. Kara feels a thrill of power, knowing that she's the one causing her stepmother such intense pleasure. She presses her tongue flat against Elena's clit, moving it in slow, broad strokes that make Elena's legs quiver.
Suddenly, Elena's body goes taut, her eyes squeeze shut, and she cries out, her juices spurting out like a geyser. Kara is caught off guard by the sudden wetness, her eyes widening in shock as she feels the warm liquid hit her cheeks and chin. But she doesn't pull away, instead, she continues to lick and suck, eager to taste every drop of Elena's sudden squirty climax.
The sound of Elena's squirting fills the room, a wet symphony of pleasure that seems to go on forever. Kara's eyes are glued to the sight of her stepmother's pussy contracting and releasing, her own body responding with a throb of need.
She's never seen anything so erotic, so powerful, and she knows she loves every second of it.
Some more clear juices drip out of Elena's pussy, and Kara eagerly laps them up, her tongue tracing the delicate lines of her stepmother's folds. The taste is unlike anything she's ever experienced, a heady mix of sweetness and musk that makes her mouth water for more.
Elena's grip on her stepdaughter's hair loosens, and she sags against the bed, her breath coming in ragged gasps.
Kara busily licks her fingers and exclaims, "Holy shit! You tasted...amazing," she says, her voice a mix of surprise and satisfaction.
Elena lets out a few choked laughs, her body still trembling with the aftershocks of her orgasm. She looks at Kara with a soft smile, her eyes gleaming with affection and lust, "You're a natural, Kara," she says, her voice still shaky, "Come here, let me taste you. It's only fair."
Kara nervously covers her own damp panties with her hand, feeling the heat of her own desire, "But...what if...what if I don't know how to?" she stammers, her cheeks reddening even more.
Elena's smile turns reassuring, "Don't know how to what, hmm?"
"Squirt...like you. You were the fucking water canon queen just now," Kara whispers, her voice filled with a mix of awe and nerves.
Elena casually chuckles, a sound that's music to Kara's ears. She feels like she's floating on a cloud of pure, unadulterated lust.
"Even if you don't gush, I'll still love it," Elena says, her voice a soothing balm to Kara's nerves. She gently coaxes Kara to lie back on the bed, her hands tracing a fiery path along Kara's thighs until they reach the damp fabric of her panties, "Let me show you," she whispers, her breath hot against Kara's ear.
Kara interrupts with a request. "Can...can I--"
Elena is gentle and encouraging, her thumbs tracing the edges of Kara's panties, making her squirm in anticipation, "What is it, sweetheart?" she whispers, her eyes sparkling with excitement.
Kara takes a deep breath and nods, her hands moving to help Elena pull the soaked fabric away from her body.
Kara struggles for the right words to formulate her request, her face flushing a deep crimson, "Can I sit on your face?" she blurts out, her voice a mix of embarrassment and hopefulness.
Elena throws her head back in laughter that is not derisive or mocking, but one that holds a hint of delight, "Of course, K!"
She murmurs, her voice thick with lust, "Whatever makes you feel good." She lies back on the bed, her legs spread wide in invitation. Kara's heart is racing like a wild horse, and she feels a strange mix of nervousness and excitement as she positions herself over Elena's face.
"Gently now, darling. Adjust your position a bit...more...yes, that's it," Elena instructs, her voice an instructive one as Kara carefully straddles her face, her legs trembling with anticipation. She feels the warmth of Elena's breath against her wet pussy, and it sends a few rapid shivers down her spine.
Elena begins to slowly kiss and lick Kara's inner thighs, her eyes never leaving Kara's as she teases and tantalizes, building the anticipation to a crescendo. Kara's legs are quivering like a leaf in the wind as she feels Elena's tongue finally touch her clit, sending a jolt of pure pleasure through her body.
Kara's eyes roll back in her head, and she gasps, "Oh FUCK, yes!" as Elena's tongue starts to circle her clit, her hands gripping the bed sheets tightly. The sensation is overwhelming, but Kara wants more. She needs more. She starts to rock her hips, guiding Elena's mouth to where she needs it most, her breath coming out in short, sharp gasps.
Elena's slurping sounds echo through the room as she devours Kara's pussy with an enthusiasm that leaves Kara's knees trembling. Kara can't help but let out a series of high-pitched moans, her body moving in a rhythm that matches Elena's tongue.
She's never felt anything like this before- the feeling of being wanted, desired, and cherished by someone who's supposed to be off-limits, yet here they are, exploring each other's bodies like it's the most natural thing in the world.
"Oh, mommy! Oh...oh, ah fuck! Yes, mommy! AAAAAAAAH! Lick me! AAAAH, OOOOOH!" Kara's voice is a symphony of pleasure, her hips rocking in perfect sync with Elena's eager and experienced tongue. She can feel her orgasm building, a delicious pressure that's about to burst like a dam.
Elena's mouth works wonders on Kara's clitoris, her tongue flicking and teasing, bringing Kara closer and closer to the edge of a powerful climax. Kara's moans grow louder, filling the room, as she rides Elena's face, her body arching with every touch. It's like nothing she's ever felt before; the taboo nature of it all just makes it so much more intense!
Elena laps up those salty and tangy juices, her tongue delving deeper into Kara's pussy with every pass. Kara's moans become more frantic as she feels the pressure building, her thighs tightening around Elena's head, "Mommy...I'm...I'm gonna come," she stammers, her voice breaking with every word.
Elena slurps and makes other erotic noises as she pleasures Kara, her own excitement building from the taste of her stepdaughter's arousal. Kara's hips begin to move faster, her breaths coming in short, sharp gasps as she approaches the peak of her climax. "Mommy, I'm so close... don't stop, please, don't stop," she begs, her voice desperate and needy.
Elena is only too glad to oblige, her tongue flicking and swirling around Kara's clit with renewed vigor. She feels Kara's body tighten, her muscles clenching around her mouth as she brings her to the edge of ecstasy. Kara's thighs are shaking, and her breath comes in quick pants as she tries to hold on for dear life.
She lets out a shaky scream-moan as she reaches her peak, her body wildly bucking against Elena's mouth. Elena drinks in her sweet nectar, relishing the feeling of Kara's orgasm as it rips through her body. The room is filled with the sounds of Kara's pleasure, her cries echoing off the walls as she rides the wave of her climax.
Kara pants like a marathon runner who's just reached the finish line, her body collapsing onto Elena's as she comes down from the high of her orgasm. The tremors of pleasure still ripple through her, making her legs wobble like Jell-O.
"That--that was sooo fuckin' awesome. I--I've never experienced anything like that, and I've been with a ton of chicks!" Kara gasps, her body still shaking with aftershocks.
Elena strokes Kara's sweat-ridden hair, "I've been with far more than you have, darling," she says with a knowing smirk, "But I'm so happy that I could give you something so intense...and meaningful."
Kara places her head on Elena's chest and snuggles into a nice and comfortable position, listening to the steady rhythm of her stepmother's heart beating beneath her ear, "I--I'm so sorry," she whispers, feeling a tad bit guilty.
"For what?"
"For being so rude and snide all the time," Kara murmurs into Elena's chest, her voice muffled but earnest. She feels Elena's chuckle vibrate through her.
"Oh, it's understandable, K. You came from one of them big cities where things are...different," Elena says, her voice gentle and soothing.
Kara can feel the warmth of her stepmother's body beneath her, and she nuzzles closer. The guilt is slowly fading away, replaced by a warm, content feeling she hasn't felt in a long time.
Kara decides to entertain her burning curiosity by asking, "How many women have you uh...slept with?" she looks up at Elena, her eyes searching for any trace of judgment or sarcasm, but only finding warmth and understanding.
Elena responds to Kara's question with a sultry chuckle, "Why don't we say I've had my fair share of many a lovely lady, darling," she teases, her eyes twinkling with mischief, "But you, Kara, you're special. You're not just any woman; you're my stepdaughter."
Kara nervously asks, "Does that mean you like me more than the others?" She's afraid to hear the answer, but she needs to know.
Elena looks at her with a gentle smile, her eyes filled with a warmth that melts away any remaining ice from their previous encounters.
Elena coos softly, her hand stroking Kara's hair, "You're not just any ol' gal to me, Kara. You're my family. And that makes this...complicated, but also incredibly intimate. I never expected to feel this way, but here we are."
She pauses, her thumb tracing Kara's cheek. "But you have nothing to worry about. You're special to me in ways I can't even explain."
Kara buries her head deeper in Elena's chest, feeling the warmth of her stepmother's skin against her cheek. She whispers, "I--I've never felt this way before."
"I have. Once, a while ago. She was about your age," Elena shares, her voice a gentle whisper as she plays with the loose strands of Kara's hair, "But it's different with you. You're not just a fling or a passing fancy. You're a part of me now."
"I uh...I love you, Elena."
A smile begins to form on Elena's lips, but she quickly suppresses it, not quite ready to let the depth of her feelings show. She plays it cool, teasingly saying, "Aww, you say that to all the gals you been with?"
Kara can feel Elena's heart flutter against her cheek, and she knows the older woman isn't as unfazed as she's pretending to be.
"No. OK, maybe, but I--I'm serious. I think I'm in lo--love," Kara stammers, her heart racing with the admission. She feels Elena's body stiffen beneath her, but her stepmother's hands don't stop their gentle stroking of her back.
"Well, then. I love you, too Kara Phelps. Didn't expect that, did ya?" Elena's voice is light and playful, but Kara can feel the gravity of the words resonating deep within her.
Kara exhales a sigh of relief and she cups Elena's cheek, turning upwards to look into her eyes, "Really?"
"Really."
Kara nuzzles into Elena's neck, her heart swelling with joy, "What do we do now?" she asks, her voice small and vulnerable.
"Put your head on my chest...and fall asleep to the sound of my beating heart," Elena murmurs, her voice soothing like a gentle lullaby.
Kara does as she's told, feeling the steady rhythm beneath her ear, lulling her into a peaceful state. The room is quiet, except for their intermittent breaths and the occasional bird chirping or car passing by.
Before she's about to fall asleep, Kara whispers, "Can I send a selfie of us to my close friend?" Her voice is hopeful, but tinged with uncertainty.
"Why?"
"I think she might be uh...open for a uh...threesome, if you're down for it," Kara says, her voice a mix of excitement and trepidation.
Elena's heart skips a beat, but she keeps her composure. She's always had a wild streak, but this was uncharted territory even for her.
Elena exclaims, "A threesome?!"
She laughs lightly, her voice a mix of surprise and intrigue, "Well, aren't you the adventurous one?"
Kara nods, her cheeks burning with excitement, "I--I mean, if it's OK with you, of course."
Elena considers it for a moment, her eyes flickering with curiosity, "Let's talk to her first, make sure she's on the same page," she says, her voice measured but definitely not dismissive.
Kara's heart skips a beat at the idea of sharing this moment with someone she trusts.
Kara leaves the warm and comforting embrace of Elena's chest to grab her phone from her room, her heart racing with excitement. She quickly types out a text to her friend, attaching a photo of the 2 of them, their bodies entwined and faces flushed with passion.
She can feel Elena's gaze on her as she hits send, her stomach flipping with anticipation.
The reply from Kara's friend is near instantaneous, the phone lighting up with a notification that pierces the quiet of the room. The message is simple but loaded with excitement: "OMG! You absolute slut, you fucking did it!"
Kara shows the text to Elena, her eyes naughty and gleaming with mischief.
Kara sticks her tongue out, the tip touching Elena's ear, teasing a shiver out of her, "Looks like she's interested," she whispers, her voice a siren's call to further indulgence.
Elena huskily whispers back, "Well, I suppose we could...entertain the idea," her voice is filled with both surprise and intrigue. She sits up, her eyes glinting with excitement as she reads the text over Kara's shoulder. The prospect of bringing someone else into their intimate bubble sends a thrill down her spine.
Kara types out a playful message, inviting her friend to come over and join them sometime this week, her fingers trembling slightly with excitement. She's never done anything like this before, but with Elena's reassuring presence, she feels bold enough to explore her boundaries.
Kara's friend replies with a string of emojis that scream enthusiasm and excitement. Kara's heart races as she reads the response, her mind swirling with the possibilities of what's to come (literally or otherwise).
She looks up at Elena with wide eyes, her cheeks flushed with anticipation, "Looks like she's in!" she says, her voice barely above a whisper.
Elena nods her head, satisfied. Then, she pulls Kara into a tight embrace, kissing her deeply, their tongues tangling together, "We'll take it slow," she whispers into Kara's ear, her breath hot and sweet, "But for now, let's just enjoy each other."
"Yes, m--mommy," Kara coos as she rests her head back down on Elena's chest, feeling the warmth and safety of her stepmother's embrace. They lay there for a few more moments, their bodies sticky with sweat and other passionately erotic juices, their hearts beating in sync with one another's.
In sweet time, they fall asleep, nestled and wrapped in each other's arms, their legs intertwined like ivy climbing a wall. Their breaths synchronize, rising and falling in a rhythm that mirrors their newfound closeness.
The quiet is occasionally pierced by the distant sounds of the night, but in their bubble of intimacy, they are safe and sound.
Story 6:
