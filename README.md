Yeah, this is the place where I'll store my stuff. Updates will come when they do. Many more fics (mostly long) are planned for the next few years (yes, years).

All of the fanfics will be released for FREE on QuoteV.

Standard Content/Trigger Warnings apply (but are not necessarily limited to):-

Intense Violence, Blood & Gore, Strong Language, Sexual Content/Scenes, Full & Partial Nudity, Alcohol Consumption, Smoking, Human & Animal Death, and so on.
