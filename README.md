# paddy-fanfics

Yeah, this is the place where I'll store my stuff. Updates will come when they do. Many more fics (mostly long) are planned for the next few years (yes, years).

All of the fanfics will be released for FREE on AO3, QuoteV, and a gitBook page, and others (TBD). Mirrors and maximum accessibility is what I aim for.

Intense Violence, Blood & Gore, Torture, Strong Language, Slurs, Bigotry/Hate, Racism, Ableism, Sexual Content/Scenes, Full & Partial Nudity, Queerphobia, Alcohol/Substance Consumption, Rape/Non-Con, Smoking, Heavy Drug Usage, Human & Animal Death, and so on.
