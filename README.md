# paddy-fanfics

Yeah, this is the place where I'll store my stuff. Updates will come when they do. Many more fics (mostly long) are planned for the next few years (yes, years).

All of the fanfics will be released for FREE on AO3, QuoteV, and a gitBook page. Mirrors and maximum accessibility is what I aim for.
