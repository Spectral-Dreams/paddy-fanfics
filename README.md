# paddy-fanfics

Yeah, this is the place where I'll store my stuff. Updates will come when they do. Many more fics (mostly long) are planned for the next few years (yes, years).

All of the fanfics will be released for FREE on AO3, QuoteV, and a gitBook page, and others (TBD). Mirrors and maximum accessibility is what I aim for.

Standard Content/Trigger Warnings apply (but are not necessarily limited to):-

Intense Violence, Blood & Gore, Torture, Strong Language, Slurs, Bigotry/Hate, Racism, Ableism, Sexual Content/Scenes, Full & Partial Nudity, Queerphobia, Alcohol/Substance Consumption, Rape/Non-Con, Smoking, Heavy Drug Usage, Human & Animal Death, and so on.

^(Mainly applicable to the WOD fanfics, the other thing is...different. If you know, you know).

FF1 (1) and (2) is VTM: Shadows Over Plaintry

(1) is the full thing

(2) will likely be the version with commentary (TBD)

"NC0" is something else entirely, check that out at your own risk.

What's being worked on now/Roadmap:-

WIP: VTM: The Golden Goose (FF3) and VTM: The Den Of Snakes (FF4)

WIP: Adding more to NC0 and publish before year end.

Early Access for VTM: The Golden Goose and VTM: The Den Of Snakes planned SOON (tm), likely before the year ends. TBD, no exact date.

Early-Mid 2026: Full Release for VTM: The Golden Goose and VTM: The Den Of Snakes

Early-Mid 2026: Writing begins on VTM: The Velvet Curtain and VTM: Aeterna Servitus
